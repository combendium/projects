Proteins: Templates and Matrices in Molecular Imprinting,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823070110,REVIEWS,02 August 2023,This review considers the issues of molecular imprinting with the participation of proteins. Works in the field of bioimprinting published over the past five years and devoted to the determination of biomolecules and the enhancement of enzymatic activity are analyzed. Attention is focused on the imprinting of proteins as a method of modifying the molecular structure of proteins due to the formation of binding sites in the presence of substrates (proteins with molecular imprints or imprinted proteins). It is shown that the imprinting of proteins is promising for solving analytical problems. The ambiguous interpretation of the term bioimprinting in solving various problems is discussed.
Determination and Quantification of Cetirizine Dihydrochloride in Pharmaceutical Formulations and Biological Fluids Through Fluorescence Quenching of Eosin Y: Application to Content Uniformity Test,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823080129,ARTICLES,02 August 2023,"A simple, fast, sensitive, cost-effective, and well-proven spectrofluorimetric method has been developed for the quantification of cetirizine dihydrochloride (CTZ). The quenching effect of CTZ on the fluorescence intensity of Eosin Y was utilized to generate an ion-pair complex that can be detected at 549 nm using a 301 nm excitation wavelength in the presence of glycine buffer (pH 4.0) for the method development. The factors that influence reactions were thoroughly examined and optimized. With a determination coefficient of 0.9996, the fluorescence quenching value was linear to CTZ concentration in the range of 1–40 µg/mL. The estimated detection and quantification limits were determined to be 0.02 and 0.08 µg/mL, respectively. The method selectivity was validated by analyzing the effects of excipients, and no interference was found. The established approach was applied to determine the presence of CTZ in products available on the market as well as in biological samples. The methodology was validated using guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization, and percent recoveries for pharmaceutical items varied from 90.6 to 103.5% and for biological fluids from 97.9 to 102.5%. The method has been successfully used for the content uniformity test with high percent recovery and low relative standard deviation."
Experience of the Determination of Fluorine in Rocks by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823080117,ARTICLES,02 August 2023,"The main fluorine-concentrating minerals in rocks are mainly apatites, amphiboles, micas, fluorites, sphenes, villiomites, in which fluorine is found in compounds with Ca, Mg, Na. The yield of the X‑ray fluorescence of fluorine depends on the element with which it is chemically bound. Taking into account this factor, three versions of calibration dependences for fluorine in the composition of CaF2, MgF2, and NaF were obtained using pressed tablets. Mixtures of these fluorides with granite, basalt, and limestone were used for calibration. To select an adequate calibration for the determination of fluorine in a batch of unknown samples, it was proposed to use the results of a selective analysis of fused samples of the batch."

The relative systematic error in determining the concentration of an element in the range of measuring the absorbance of atomic vapor does not exceed 10%. The analytical ranges for the elements exceed three orders of magnitude."

It is shown that additives of 0.1–6 wt % of polar organic compounds greatly increase the intensity of Pb, Tl, and Zn lines and reduce the intensity of Ag lines. The greatest effect, a twenty-fold enhancement of zinc lines, is observed upon the introduction of methanol into dilute acids. The cadmium signal is insensitive to organic impurities in dilute acids, but is enhanced in concentrated salt solutions."

Conducting the multichannel and scientific characterization and comparison of them is in urgent need to draw objective and fair conclusions, demonstrating the fair and equitable administration of justice. With the help of infrared spectroscopy (IR), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) and stereomicroscopy, the properties of three paint flakes from automobiles at the scene of the accident have been studied for forensic purposes in this paper. Primary discussion is progressed according to the stereomicroscope and SEM images, while the in-depth conclusion is proved by the component analysis acquired with EDS, IR and Raman. Furthermore, colors, thickness, sequence, microstructure and composition of layers provide much significant information. The third layers of all the samples show the significant changes clearly, indicating that sample C is different from samples A and B. However, the first, second and fourth layers give rise to consistent analysis profiles. The results of this study provide the significant fundamental information which can be used to analyze the paint flakes for forensic scientists."
Using Highly Sensitive Piezo Sensors in an Open System for the Diagnostic Analysis of Skin Volatile Substances,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823080105,ARTICLES,02 August 2023,"A single sensor with a piezoelectric quartz transducer is considered a platform for simulating an “electronic nose” that performs the function of a sensor array. The analytical task was to detect volatile organic compounds, component-by-component, in biosamples at diagnostically relevant concentrations without selecting mixtures or any sample preparation. We confirmed the fundamental possibility of utilizing a single sensor for the separate detection (recognition) of vapors of organic compounds and various functional states of a body during a short contact (60–80 s) with skin, the most representative and constantly performing bioassay. Modifying the electrodes of bulk acoustic wave piezoelectric quartz resonators with 2–4 μg of the nanohydroxyapatite phase is an essential step in solving the problem. The newly calculated adsorption kinetic parameters can be used to detect biomarkers of many diseases with high reliability, including С3–С5 alcohols, ketones, linear and cyclic amines, acids, aldehydes, etc. The hydroxyapatite sensor can detect molecules pointing to problems with many organs, and any abnormalities in the functioning of the nervous and cardiovascular systems. It can also measure the body’s responses and compensatory mechanisms in relation to stress, hunger, and fatigue. The sensor has a potential as a simple diagnostic and monitoring tool for point-of-care diagnostics of both adults and children."
Development of a Bioanalytical Method for the Determination of Aureofungin and Its Sodium Salt Derivative Using HPLC: an Application to Pharmacokinetic Studies,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823080154,ARTICLES,02 August 2023,"Since fungal infections are on the rise and with limited treatment options, there is a need to modify existing drugs either by making structural changes or making use of better drug delivery systems. Aureofungin, an antibiotic of a polyene class, is primarily used to prevent fungal infection in agriculture. However, it has limited application in clinical therapy due to high toxicity. Therefore, a water-soluble sodium salt derivative of aureofungin was synthesized as a promising antifungal agent, which required a bioanalytical method to be established for the quantitation in the biological matrix and thereby understanding its pharmacokinetics. As a result, in the present work, a simple and rapid reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed for the determination of aureofungin bulk and its water-soluble derivative in rat plasma. The analytes were separated in an isocratic mode using a C18 amide column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) and a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile (55 : 45, v/v) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at ambient temperature and detection at 378 nm. The analyte was efficiently extracted using a simple protein precipitation technique. The methodology was found to be linear (r2 ≥ 0.995), selective, repeatable (CV ≤ 15.0%), accurate (100 ± 15%), and free of any carryover effects. Under the investigated storage conditions, the bioanalytical samples demonstrated acceptable stability. An oral pharmacokinetic study in rats was then performed to verify the applicability of the method."

The focal activity of the rat olfactory bulb was recorded using an array of 16 special electrodes implanted in the dorsal part of the rat olfactory bulb. The setup contained a box with a rat, sources of vapors (odorants), a multichannel digital system for recording electrical signals from an electrode array, and software performing algorithms for recognizing and classifying odorants presented to the rat. One source of TNT vapors was a device for batch volumetric preparation with a concentration of about 10–15 g/cm3, and another source was a source with a concentration of 4.7 × 10–15 g/cm3 in an air flow presented to rats. Data from 25 tests showed a 100% probability of detecting TNT vapors of the specified concentrations in pure air and also in the presence of a complex odor interference in the form of vapors from a mixture of red pepper, coriander, tobacco, etc., which, as a rule, mask the smell of TNT for animals."
Estimation of Organic Opacifier in Water-Based Architectural Coatings Using Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193482308004X,ARTICLES,02 August 2023,"Hollow sphere polymeric pigments prepared from styrene-acrylate copolymer referred to as organic opacifiers (OP) are the primary substitutes of TiO2 in water-based architectural paints. This study describes the method for the quantification of OP in water-based paints using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The significance of DMTA in visualizing the glass transitions over differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is showcased. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of OP was found to be ~109°C by DSC method and ~125°C by DMTA method. The peak intensity of tan δ at Tg of OP in paints (tan δ2) is not affected by the curing time and linearly increases as a function of OP concentration in water-based paints, irrespective of the difference in volume solids. DMTA can efficiently quantify OP in paint film if it is ≥3.3% (w/w). Increasing concentration of a coalescing solvent in water-based paints has a detrimental effect on the peak intensity of tan δ2. Two commercially available grades of OP having difference in the core-shell morphology have been studied. Internal morphology of the OP studied by scanning electron microscopy has a significant effect on the peak intensity of tan δ2 thereby affecting its opacity performance in paints. Owing to the limited effect of curing time, volume solids and coalescing solvent on the peak intensity of tan δ2 of paints, this method can be used for the quantification of OP in paints, as it has been validated with seven commercially available paints with known OP contents."
Systematic Errors in the Results of Quantitative Chemical Analysis: from Incorrect Terms to Erroneous Concepts,"August 2023, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823060102,DISCUSSIONS,02 August 2023,"It is noticed that the conventional interpretation of systematic errors (or, what is the same, the list of varieties of systematic errors) generally reflects the actual situation, which does not exclude some refilling and specification with the appearance of new types of measurements and the sophistication of the existing ones. These additions should not mean the abolition of the general metrological, time-tested classification. In recent decades, trends have appeared aimed at replacing the meanings of terms and definitions with those uncharacteristic of them, or at introducing terms that have no real meaning at all into metrological practice. This, in turn, led to the emergence of erroneous concepts ensuring the accuracy of the results of quantitative chemical analysis and to the creation of far from perfect regulatory documents, which, among other reasons, was due to an uncritical attitude to international standards. Such concepts bring inaccuracies and erroneous recommendations into monographs and textbooks containing sections related to the metrological aspects of chemical analysis."

The optimal conditions for the formation of Zr(IV)−HPMPC complex in a ratio of 1 : 3 (M : L) were investigated. The resulting complex has yellow color and allows for the micro level measurement of zirconium in a straightforward and cost-effective manner. The process is quick, sensitive (1.073 × 105 L/mol cm) and selective. A good linearity (r = 0.9998) was observed for Zr(IV) in the range of 0.20–0.8 µg/mL. The approach is extremely repeatable with acceptable precision and accuracy (RSD of 0.3%) and can be expanded to include the examination of zirconium in a variety of samples (synthetic, natural and technical). The analytical investigation was successfully extended to DFT calculations to forecast the structural geometry and confirm the complex ultimate stoichiometry. The calculations not only produced an optimal complex structure, but also confirmed the bidentate ligand chelating efficacy by coordinating benzopyran ring to the metal center."

The methods were applied after the division of each zero-order spectrum of SSD and SH by the spectrum of paraben to exclude it. Method A, a dual wavelength of ratio spectra method, is based on selection of two wavelengths at which the peak amplitude of SH is the same but different for SSD, so wavelengths of 258.0 and 312.6 nm were used to determine SSD in the presence of SH. Other two wavelengths were selected at 208.0 and 238.4 nm for the determination of SH in the presence of SSD. Method B was first derivative spectrophotometry for the determination of SSD and fourth derivative spectrophotometry for the determination of SH. Peak amplitudes were measured at 236.0 and 225.2 nm for SSD and SH, respectively. The proposed methods were validated according to ICH recommendations. The calibration curves for the proposed methods were linear over a concentration range of 1.0–10 and 25–250 µg/mL for SSD and SH, respectively. The specificity of the proposed methods was tested using different laboratory prepared mixtures of both drugs showing high specificity of SSD and SH with accepted recovery values.

The optimal version of the structure of the functional layer in two series of the obtained stationary phases was chosen, which provides the best hydrophilization for each substrate. Retention mechanisms were studied and the conditions for the mass-spectrometric detection, separation, and determination of 16 amino acids were chosen. The applicability of the obtained adsorbents and a method for determining amino acids for the analysis of soil extracts were estimated."
A Voltammetric Sensor Based on Aluminophosphate Zeolite and a Composite of Betulinic Acid with a Chitosan Polyelectrolyte Complex for the Identification and Determination of Naproxen Enantiomers,"July 2023, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823070158,ARTICLES,18 July 2023,"A voltammetric sensor was developed based on a glassy carbon electrode with aluminophosphate zeolite finely dispersed on its surface, modified with a polyelectrolyte complex of chitosan with succinyl chitosan and betulinic acid, for the selective detection and determination of naproxen enantiomers. The electrochemical and analytical characteristics of the sensor were studied, and the effective electrode surface area (A = 9.8 ± 0.5 mm2) and charge transfer resistance (Ret = 649.9 ± 0.4 Ω) were calculated. In determining naproxen enantiomers, calibration characteristics are linear in the range from 2.5 × 10–5 to 1 × 10–3 M with limits of detection of 1.1 × 10–7 and 1.5 × 10–7 M and limits of quantification of 3.6 × 10–7 and 4.9 × 10–7 M for R- and S-naproxen, respectively. The sensor is more sensitive to R-naproxen (∆Ep = 60 mV, ipR/ipS = 1.40). The proposed sensor was used to recognize and determine naproxen enantiomers in human urine and plasma samples. Statistical evaluation of the results by the standard addition method showed that there was no systematic error."
Cathode Nanophosphors,"July 2023, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/78-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934823070134,ARTICLES,18 July 2023,"High-current cathodic pulses on an aluminum electrode in solutions containing sufficiently high concentrations of Mg, Ca, Sr, Al, Sc, Y, or La nitrates in a mixture with H3BO3, HF, H3PO4, or H4P2O7 are accompanied by an intense intrinsic luminescence of a number of heavy metals, the ions of which are captured by salt nanofilms and luminescence under the action of hot electrons when are in an environment characteristic of crystal phosphors. The effect of the cathode nanophosphor (CNP) was found in more than 100 systems; photographs are presented for most of the systems. Ga, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, Mn, Cu, Ag, Cd, Ce, Tb, and Zr ions were activators. The effect of matrix composition on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the CNP was shown on several examples; a qualitative description of the phenomenon is given, and the prospects for its application to chemical analysis are considered."
