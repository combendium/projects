Rules for mass spectrometry applications in the clinical laboratory,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04648-0,Feature Article,25 March 2023,"MS-based analytical methods now play an important role in medical laboratory analysis. Predominantly triple-stage mass spectrometry is used for the quantification of small molecule biomarkers and xenobiotics in blood and urine. The spectrum of applications ranges from completely in-house developed analytical methods, to industrially manufactured kit solutions used on generic equipment, to the first closed MS-based analysis systems. It is to be expected that the weights will shift in the coming years. Thus, operation and evaluation for most applications will remain very challenging and very different from the far more user-friendly and fully automated systems — mainly photometry-based — which are commonly used in clinical laboratories. General regulatory requirements for medical analysis differ significantly between countries globally. General requirements for in-house developed assay methods are valid in some countries, but concrete and methodology-specific rules for operation and quantification when using MS methods in the medical diagnostic laboratory are not applied. This differs significantly from other bio-analytical areas such as food monitoring, pharmaceutical research, or forensics, where legally binding, detailed rules exist in some cases, e.g., for substance identification. Internationally used relevant and helpful general standards with regard to mass spectrometric examination procedures in the clinical laboratory are in particular CLSI 62A and ISO 15189, while the IVDR in the EU primarily regulates the manufacture of diagnostic articles and not their application. In addition, from many years of application experience, some general advice can be recommended as rules that can contribute to robustness and patient safety in the clinical application of MS procedures; with emphasis on: reasonable method description, batch release, competence management, maintenance, and continuity management. This article also proposes some procedural basic requirements for the application of MS procedures in the clinical laboratory."
Strategies for automating analytical and bioanalytical laboratories,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04727-2,Feature Article,13 May 2023,"Analytical measurement methods are used in different areas of production and quality control, diagnostics, environmental monitoring, or in research applications. If direct inline or online measurement methods are not possible, the samples taken have to be processed offline in the manual laboratory. Automated processes are increasingly being used to enhance throughput and improve the quality of results. In contrast to bioscreening, the degree of automation in (bio)analytical laboratories is still low. This is due in particular to the complexity of the processes, the required process conditions, and the complex matrices of the samples. The requirements of the process to be automated itself and numerous other parameters influence the selection of a suitable automation concept. Different automation strategies can be used to automate (bio)analytical processes. Classically, liquid handler-based systems are used. For more complex processes, systems with central robots are used to transport samples and labware. With the development of new collaborative robots, there will also be the possibility of distributed automation systems in the future, which will enable even more flexible automation and use of all subsystems. The complexity of the systems increases with the complexity of the processes to be automated."
The role of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography in mineral oil determination,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04718-3,Critical Review,06 May 2023,"Mineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) contain a wide structural diversity of molecules, for which the reference method of analysis is the online coupled liquid chromatography-gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (LC-GC-FID). These compounds are very heterogeneous from a toxicological viewpoint, and an accurate risk assessment when dealing with a MOH contamination can only be performed if sufficient information is available on the types of structures present (i.e., number of carbons, degree of alkylation, number of aromatic rings). Unfortunately, the separation performances of the current LC-GC-FID method are insufficient for such characterization, not even mentioning the possible coelution of interfering compounds which additionally hinder MOH determination. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC), while mostly used for confirmation purposes in the past, starts to prove its relevance for overcoming the weaknesses of the LC-GC method and reaching even better the analytical requirements defined in the latest EFSA opinion. The present paper therefore aims at highlighting how GC × GC has contributed to the understanding of the MOH topic, how it has developed to meet the requirements of MOH determination, and how it could play a role in the field for overcoming many of the current analytical and toxicological challenges related to the topic."
Confocal micro X-ray fluorescence analysis for the non-destructive investigation of structured and inhomogeneous samples,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04829-x,Critical Review,24 July 2023,"Confocal micro X-ray fluorescence (CMXRF) spectroscopy is a non-destructive, depth-resolved, and element-specific technique that is used to analyze the elemental composition of a sample. For this, a focused beam of mono- or polychromatic X-rays is applied to excite the atoms in the sample, causing them to emit fluorescence radiation which is detected with focusing capillary optics. The confocal design of the instrument allows for depth-resolved analysis, in most cases with a resolution in the lower micrometer dimension after collecting X-rays from a predefined volume within the sample. The element-specific nature of the technique allows information to be obtained about the presence and concentration of specific elements in this volume. This makes CMXRF spectroscopy a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, especially when samples with an inhomogeneous distribution of elements and a relatively light matrix have to be analyzed, which are typical examples in materials science, geology, and biology. The technique is also commonly used in the art and archaeology fields to analyze the elemental composition of historical artifacts and works of art, helping to provide valuable insights into their provenance, composition, and making. Recent technical developments to increase sensitivity and efforts to improve quantification in three-dimensional samples will encourage wider use of this method across a multitude of fields of application in the near future."
Advances in testing for sample manipulation in clinical and forensic toxicology - Part A: urine samples,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04711-w,Critical Review,05 May 2023,"In many countries, adherence testing is used to monitor consumption behavior or to prove abstinence. Urine and hair are most commonly used, although other biological fluids are available. Positive test results are usually associated with serious legal or economic consequences. Therefore, various sample manipulation and adulteration strategies are used to circumvent such a positive result. In these critical review articles on sample adulteration of urine (part A) and hair samples (part B) in the context of clinical and forensic toxicology, recent trends and strategies to improve sample adulteration and manipulation testing published in the past 10 years are described and discussed. Typical manipulation and adulteration strategies include undercutting the limits of detection/cut-off by dilution, substitution, and adulteration. New or alternative strategies for detecting sample manipulation attempts can be generally divided into improved detection of established urine validity markers and direct and indirect techniques or approaches to screening for new adulteration markers. In this part A of the review article, we focused on urine samples, where the focus in recent years has been on new (in)direct substitution markers, particularly for synthetic (fake) urine. Despite various and promising advances in detecting manipulation, it remains a challenge in clinical and forensic toxicology, and simple, reliable, specific, and objective markers/techniques are still lacking, for example, for synthetic urine."
Advances in testing for sample manipulation in clinical and forensic toxicology—part B: hair samples,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04706-7,Critical Review,28 April 2023,"As a continuation of part A, focusing on advances in testing for sample manipulation of urine samples in clinical and forensic toxicology, part B of the review article relates to hair, another commonly used matrix for abstinence control testing. Similar to urine manipulation, relevant strategies to manipulate a hair test are lowering drug concentrations in hair to undercut the limits of detection/cut-offs, for instance, by forced washout effects or adulteration. However, distinguishing between usual, common cosmetic hair treatment and deliberate manipulation to circumvent a positive drug test is often impossible. Nevertheless, the identification of cosmetic hair treatment is very relevant in the context of hair testing and interpretation of hair analysis results. Newly evaluated techniques or elucidation of specific biomarkers to unravel adulteration or cosmetic treatment often focused on specific structures of the hair matrix with promising strategies recently proposed for daily routine work. Identification of other approaches, e.g., forced hair-washing procedures, still remains a challenge in clinical and forensic toxicology."
Integrated microscale immiscible phase extraction and isothermal amplification for colorimetric detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04734-3,Research Paper,18 May 2023,"Gonorrhea is the second most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) with around 87 million cases worldwide estimated in 2016 by the World Health Organization. With over half of the cases being asymptomatic, potential life-threatening complications and increasing numbers of drug-resistant strains, routine monitoring of prevalence and incidence of infections are key preventive measures. Whilst gold standard qPCR tests have excellent accuracy, they are neither affordable nor accessible in low-resource settings. In this study, we developed a lab-on-a-chip platform based on microscale immiscible filtration to extract, concentrate and purify Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA with an integrated detection assay based on colorimetric isothermal amplification. The platform was capable of detecting as low as 500 copies/mL from spiked synthetic urine and showed no cross-reactivity when challenged with DNAs from other common STIs. The credit card–size device allows DNA extraction and purification without power or centrifuges, and the detection reaction only needs a low-tech block heater, providing a straightforward and visual positive/negative result within 1 h. These advantages offer great potential for accurate, affordable and accessible monitoring of gonorrhea infection in resource-poor settings."
Immunomagnetic separation coupled with flow cytometry for the analysis of Legionella pneumophila in aerosols,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04738-z,Research Paper,18 May 2023,"Legionella pneumophila are pathogenic bacteria that can be found in high concentrations in artificial water systems like evaporative cooling towers, which have been the source of frequent outbreaks in recent years. Since inhaled L. pneumophila can lead to Legionnaires’ disease, the development of suitable sampling and rapid analysis strategies for these bacteria in aerosols is therefore of great relevance. In this work, different concentrations of viable L. pneumophila Sg 1 were nebulized and sampled by the cyclone sampler Coriolis® µ under defined conditions in a bioaerosol chamber. To quantify intact Legionella cells, the collected bioaerosols were subsequently analyzed by immunomagnetic separation coupled with flow cytometry (IMS-FCM) on the platform rqmicro.COUNT. For analytical comparison, measurements with qPCR and cultivation were performed. Limits of detection (LOD) of 2.9 × 103 intact cells m−3 for IMS-FCM and 7.8 × 102 intact cells m−3 for qPCR indicating a comparable sensitivity as in culture (LOD = 1.5 × 103 culturable cells m−3). Over a working range of 103 − 106 cells mL−1, the analysis of nebulized and collected aerosol samples with IMS-FCM and qPCR provides higher recovery rates and more consistent results than by cultivation. Overall, IMS-FCM is a suitable culture-independent method for quantification of L. pneumophila in bioaerosols and is promising for field application due to its simplicity in sample preparation."
Tailored extraction and ion mobility-mass spectrometry enables isotopologue analysis of tetrahydrofolate vitamers,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04786-5,Research Paper,22 June 2023,"Climate change directs the focus in biotechnology increasingly on one-carbon metabolism for fixation of CO2 and CO2-derived chemicals (e.g. methanol, formate) to reduce our reliance on both fossil and food-competing carbon sources. The tetrahydrofolate pathway is involved in several one-carbon fixation pathways. To study such pathways, stable isotope-labelled tracer analysis performed with mass spectrometry is state of the art. However, no such method is currently available for tetrahydrofolate vitamers. In the present work, we established a fit-for-purpose extraction method for the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii that allows access to intracellular methyl- and methenyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF) with demonstrated stability over several hours. To determine isotopologue distributions of methyl-THF, LC-QTOFMS provides a selective fragment ion with suitable intensity of at least two isotopologues in all samples, but not for methenyl-THF. However, the addition of ion mobility separation provided a critical selectivity improvement allowing accurate isotopologue distribution analysis of methenyl-THF with LC-IM-TOFMS. Application of these new methods for 13C-tracer experiments revealed a decrease from 83 ± 4 to 64 ± 5% in the M + 0 carbon isotopologue fraction in methyl-THF after 1 h of labelling with formate, and to 54 ± 5% with methanol. The M + 0 carbon isotopologue fraction of methenyl-THF was reduced from 83 ± 2 to 78 ± 1% over the same time when using 13C-methanol labelling. The labelling results of multiple strains evidenced the involvement of the THF pathway in the oxygen-tolerant reductive glycine pathway, the presence of the in vivo reduction of formate to formaldehyde, and the activity of the spontaneous condensation reaction of formaldehyde with THF in K. phaffii."
"Detection, chemical analysis, and pharmacological characterization of dipyanone and other new synthetic opioids related to prescription drugs","September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04722-7,Research Paper,13 May 2023,"The emergence of structurally diverse new synthetic opioids (NSOs) has caused the opioid crisis to spiral to new depths. Little information is available about the pharmacology of most novel opioids when they first emerge. Here, using a β-arrestin 2 recruitment assay, we investigated the in vitro μ-opioid receptor (MOR) activation potential of dipyanone, desmethylmoramide, and acetoxymethylketobemidone (O-AMKD) — recent NSOs that are structurally related to the prescription opioids methadone and ketobemidone. Our findings indicate that dipyanone (EC50=39.9 nM; Emax=155% vs. hydromorphone) is about equally active as methadone (EC50=50.3 nM; Emax=152%), whereas desmethylmoramide (EC50=1335 nM; Emax=126%) is considerably less active. A close structural analogue of ketobemidone (EC50=134 nM; Emax=156%) and methylketobemidone (EC50=335 nM; Emax=117%), O-AMKD showed a lower potency (EC50=1262 nM) and efficacy (Emax=109%). Evaluation of the opioid substitution product buprenorphine and its metabolite norbuprenorphine confirmed the increased in vitro efficacy of the latter. In addition to in vitro characterization, this report details the first identification and full chemical analysis of dipyanone in a seized powder, as well as a postmortem toxicology case from the USA involving the drug. Dipyanone was quantified in blood (370 ng/mL), in which it was detected alongside other NSOs (e.g., 2-methyl AP-237) and novel benzodiazepines (e.g., flualprazolam). While dipyanone is currently not commonly encountered in forensic samples worldwide, its emergence is worrisome and representative of the dynamic NSO market."
Optofluidic force induction as a process analytical technology,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04796-3,Research Paper,01 July 2023,"Manufacturers of nanoparticle-based products rely on detailed information about critical process parameters, such as particle size and size distributions, concentration, and material composition, which directly reflect the quality of the final product. These process parameters are often obtained using offline characterization techniques that cannot provide the temporal resolution to detect dynamic changes in particle ensembles during a production process. To overcome this deficiency, we have recently introduced Optofluidic Force Induction (of2i) for optical real-time counting with single particle sensitivity and high throughput. In this paper, we apply of2i to highly polydisperse and multi modal particle systems, where we also monitor evolutionary processes over large time scales. For oil-in-water emulsions we detect in real time the transition between high-pressure homogenization states. For silicon carbide nanoparticles, we exploit the dynamic of2i measurement capabilities to introduce a novel process feedback parameter based on the dissociation of particle agglomerates. Our results demonstrate that of2i provides a versatile workbench for process feedback in a wide range of applications."
Screening bisphenols in complex samples via a planar Arxula adeninivorans bioluminescence bioassay,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04820-6,Research Paper,17 July 2023,"The Arxula yeast bisphenol screen (A-YBS) utilizes the bioluminescent Arxula adeninivorans yeast–based reporter cells for tailored analysis of bisphenols, one of the major endocrine-disrupting compound groups. For the first time, this bioreporter has been applied on the high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) adsorbent surface to develop a respective planar bioluminescence bioassay (pA-YBS). The goal was to combine the advantages of HPTLC with a more selective bioassay detection for bisphenols. The performance of this pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay was demonstrated by calculating the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of bisphenols compared to references. The EC50 ranged from 267 pg/band for bisphenol Z and 322 pg/band for bisphenol A (BPA) to > 1 ng/band for other bisphenols (BPC, BPE, BPF, and BPS) and references (17β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol). The EC50 value of BPA was three times more sensitive in signal detection than that of 17β-estradiol. The visual or videodensitometric limit of detection of BPA was about 200 pg/zone. The higher signal intensity and sensitivity for BPA confirmed the tailored bioassay selectivity compared to the existing estrogen screen bioassay. It worked on different types of HPTLC silica gel plates. This HPTLC–UV/Vis/FLD–pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay method was used to analyze complex mixtures such as six tin can migrates, five thermal papers, and eleven botanicals. The detected estrogenic compound zones in the tin can migrates were successfully verified via the duplex planar yeast antagonist estrogen screen (pYAES) bioassay. The two bisphenols A and S were identified in one out of five thermal papers and confirmed with high-resolution mass spectrometry. No bisphenols were detected in the botanicals investigated via the pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay. However, the botanicals proved to contain phytoestrogens as detected via the pYAES bioassay, which confirmed the tailored bioassay selectivity. This HPTLC–UV/Vis/FLD–pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay is suited for cost-efficient analysis of BPA in complex samples, with no need for sterile conditions due to the fast workflow."
Responsive Janus droplets as modular sensory layers for the optical detection of bacteria,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04838-w,Trends,14 July 2023,"The field of biosensor development is fueled by innovations in new functional transduction materials and technologies. Material innovations promise to extend current sensor hardware limitations, reduce analysis costs, and ensure broad application of sensor methods. Optical sensors are particularly attractive because they enable sensitive and noninvasive analyte detection in near real-time. Optical transducers convert physical, chemical, or biological events into detectable changes in fluorescence, refractive index, or spectroscopic shifts. Thus, in addition to sophisticated biochemical selector designs, smart transducers can improve signal transmission and amplification, thereby greatly facilitating the practical applicability of biosensors, which, to date, is often hampered by complications such as difficult replication of reproducible selector-analyte interactions within a uniform and consistent sensing area. In this context, stimuli-responsive and optically active Janus emulsions, which are dispersions of kinetically stabilized biphasic fluid droplets, have emerged as a novel triggerable material platform that provides as a versatile and cost-effective alternative for the generation of reproducible, highly sensitive, and modular optical sensing layers. The intrinsic and unprecedented chemical-morphological-optical coupling inside Janus droplets has facilitated optical signal transduction and amplification in various chemo- and biosensor paradigms, which include examples for the rapid and cost-effective detection of major foodborne pathogens. These initial demonstrations resulted in detection limits that rival the capabilities of current commercial platforms. This trend article aims to present a conceptual summary of these initial efforts and to provide a concise and comprehensive overview of the pivotal kinetic and thermodynamic principles that govern the ability of Janus droplets to sensitively and selectively respond to and interact with bacteria."
Portable biosensor-based oral pathogenic bacteria detection for community and family applications,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04809-1,Critical Review,30 June 2023,"Detection of oral pathogens is essential in the management of oral diseases, as their occurrence and progression are closely linked to an imbalance in these microorganisms. Detection techniques such as microbial cultures, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and polymerase chain reactions are highly dependent on complex testing procedures and specialized laboratory equipment, making prevention and early diagnosis of oral diseases difficult. To comprehensively implement oral disease prevention and early diagnosis in social groups, there is an urgent need for portable testing methods for oral pathogenic bacteria that can be applied in community and home settings. In this review, several common portable biosensors for pathogenic bacteria are first described. Based on the goal of achieving primary prevention and diagnosis of oral diseases, we elaborate and summarize portable biosensors for common oral pathogenic bacteria in terms of how to achieve portability of the technique. This review aims to reflect the current status of portable biosensors for common oral pathogens and to lay the foundation for the further realization of portable detection of oral pathogens."
Raman mapping for determination of TiO2 in different solid food samples by multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04839-9,Research Paper,13 July 2023,"Titanium dioxide is a food additive commonly used as a white food coloring (E171). Its wide use by the food industry associated with the nanometric size distribution of the particles of this pigment has shown high genotoxicity associated with recurrent exposure by ingestion. Therefore, the use of E171 in food products has already been banned by some industries and in the European Union. Such banishment should soon be extended to other countries around the world, making it important to establish techniques for the efficient determination of TiO2 in different food products. The association between hyperspectral images and chemometric tools can be useful in this sense, aiming to enable the use of a single method for sample preparation and analysis of different types of food. Thus, the present work aims to evaluate the use of Raman mapping associated with the resolution of multivariate curves with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) for the determination of titanium dioxide in solid food samples with different compositions, without the need to introduce specific sample preparation. The proposed method allowed for the first-time quantification of TiO2 in different food matrices without specific sample preparation, with a simple, rapid, accurate (93% of recovery), low detection limits (0.0111% m/m) and quantification (0.0370% m/m) and adequate linearity (r = 0.9990) and precise (standard deviation around 0.020–0.030% w/w) methodology. Such results highlight the potential use of Raman mapping associated with the MCR-ALS for quantification of the nano-TiO2 in commercial samples."
Complementary methods for structural assignment of isomeric candidate structures in non-target liquid chromatography ion mobility high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis,"September 2023, issue 21",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04852-y,Research Paper,15 July 2023,"Non-target screening with LC/IMS/HRMS is increasingly employed for detecting and identifying the structure of potentially hazardous chemicals in the environment and food. Structural assignment relies on a combination of multidimensional instrumental methods and computational methods. The candidate structures are often isomeric, and unfortunately, assigning the correct structure among a number of isomeric candidate structures still is a key challenge both instrumentally and computationally. While practicing non-target screening, it is usually impossible to evaluate separately the limitations arising from (1) the inability of LC/IMS/HRMS to resolve the isomeric candidate structures and (2) the uncertainty of in silico methods in predicting the analytical information of isomeric candidate structures due to the lack of analytical standards for all candidate structures. Here we evaluate the feasibility of structural assignment of isomeric candidate structures based on in silico–predicted retention time and database collision cross-section (CCS) values as well as based on matching the empirical analytical properties of the detected feature with those of the analytical standards. For this, we investigated 14 candidate structures corresponding to five features detected with LC/HRMS in a spiked surface water sample. Considering the predicted retention times and database CCS values with the accompanying uncertainty, only one of the isomeric candidate structures could be deemed as unlikely; therefore, the annotation of the LC/IMS/HRMS features remained ambiguous. To further investigate if unequivocal annotation is possible via analytical standards, the reversed-phase LC retention times and low- and high-resolution ion mobility spectrometry separation, as well as high-resolution MS2 spectra of analytical standards were studied. Reversed-phase LC separated the highest number of candidate structures while low-resolution ion mobility and high-resolution MS2 spectra provided little means for pinpointing the correct structure among the isomeric candidate structures even if analytical standards were available for comparison. Furthermore, the question arises which prediction accuracy is required from the in silico methods to par the analytical separation. Based on the experimental data of the isomeric candidate structures studied here and previously published in the literature (516 retention time and 569 CCS values), we estimate that to reduce the candidate list by 95% of the structures, the confidence interval of the predicted retention times would need to decrease to below 0.05 min for a 15-min gradient while that of CCS values would need to decrease to 0.15%. Hereby, we set a clear goal to the in silico methods for retention time and CCS prediction."
Enzyme-targeted near-infrared fluorescent probe for organophosphorus pesticide residue detection,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04801-9,Paper in Forefront,12 July 2023,"Pesticide residues significantly affect food safety and harm human health. In this work, a series of near-infrared fluorescent probes were designed and developed by acylating the hydroxyl group of the hemicyanine skeleton with a quenching moiety for monitoring the presence of organophosphorus pesticides in food and live cells. The carboxylic ester bond on the probe was hydrolyzed catalytically in the presence of carboxylesterase and thereby the fluorophore was released with near-infrared emission. Notably, the proposed probe 1 exhibited excellent sensitivity against organophosphorus based on the carboxylesterase inhibition mechanism and the detection limit for isocarbophos achieved 0.1734 μg/L in the fresh vegetable sample. More importantly, probe 1 allowed for situ visualization of organophosphorus in live cells and bacteria, meaning great potential for tracking the organophosphorus in biological systems. Consequently, this study presents a promising strategy for tracking pesticide residues in food and biological systems."

These properties are determined with common analytical tools (mass spectrometry, cryo-EM, NMR, various spectroscopies, nucleotide sequencing, etc.) whose function can be improved when samples are pure and concentrated. Separations science plays a central role in conditioning samples, ranging from low-resolution benchtop operations like precipitations or extractions to higher-resolution chromatography and electrophoresis. In the last two decades, gradient insulator-based dielectrophoresis (g-iDEP) has emerged as a high-resolution separation technique capable of highly selective enrichment of cells, viruses, exosomes, and proteins. Specific evidence has been shown that pure homogeneous and concentrated fractions of cells and exosomes can be generated from complex mixtures. However, recovering those fractions for analysis has not been developed, limiting the technique to an analytical rather than a preparative one. Here, a finite element analysis was undertaken to identify geometries and operational parameters to efficiently remove the enriched fraction while retaining maximum concentration and providing total mass transfer. Geometric factors (e.g., side channel width and distance from the gradient-inducing gap) were studied, along with the addition of a second inlet side channel. Two flow-generating mechanisms—electroosmosis and hydrostatic pressure—were evaluated for semi-optimized device designs, including a comparison of the one- and two-inlet designs. Simulations indicate effectively one hundred percent mass transfer and a concentration increase by an order of magnitude for several device configurations and operational parameters."
Sensitive and discriminative detection of cysteine by a Nile red-based NIR fluorescence probe,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04790-9,Research Paper,15 June 2023,"Cysteine (Cys) is a significant biological mercaptan that achieves key roles in several important physiological processes, such as reversible redox homeostasis in living organisms. Abnormal levels of Cys in the human body are directly related to many diseases. In this work, we constructed a sensitive sensor (Cys-NR) by connecting a Cys recognition group to a Nile red derivative. Due to photo-induced electron transfer (PET), the Cys-NR probe showed little fluorescence at 650 nm. With the addition of Cys to the assay solution, the chlorine unit of the probe was substituted by the thiol group of Cys. Further, the amino and sulfhydryl groups in cysteine underwent an intramolecular rearrangement, which led to the Cys-NR probe water solution turning from colorless to pink with an enhancement in fluorescence. The red fluorescence at 650 nm increased about 20 times. Based on the turn-on signal, a selective Cys detection method is developed. The probe signal is not affected by various potential interferences or other competing biothiols and the limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be 0.44 μM. In addition, the probe is further employed for imaging of Cys in live cells, revealing good biological imaging ability that could provide a new way of intracellular Cys detection."

An instrument performance comparison of the benefits and limitations using matrix-matched standards containing 6 zeranols on 4 MS instruments, 2 low-resolution (linear ion traps), and 2 high-resolution (Orbitrap and ToF) was undertaken to identify the best measurement platform for multiple biomonitoring projects characterizing the endocrine disruptive properties of zeranols. Analytical figures of merit were calculated for each analyte to compare instrument performance across platforms. The calibration curves had correlation coefficients r = 0.989 ± 0.012 for all analytes and LODs and LOQs were ranked for sensitivity: Orbitrap > LTQ > LTQXL > G1 (V mode) > G1 (W mode). The Orbitrap had the smallest measured variation (lowest %CV), while the G1 had the highest. Instrumental selectivity was calculated using full width at half maximum (FWHM) and as expected, the low-resolution instruments had the broadest spectrometric peaks, concealing coeluting peaks under the same mass window as the analyte. Multiple peaks from concomitant ions, unresolved at low resolution (within a unit mass window), were present but did not match the exact mass predicted for the analyte. For example, the high-resolution platforms were able to differentiate between a concomitant peak at 319.1915 from the analyte at 319.1551, included in low-resolution quantitative analyses demonstrating the need to consider coeluting interfering ions in biomonitoring studies. Finally, a validated method using the Orbitrap was applied to human urine samples from a pilot cohort study."
Plasmon-enhanced fluorescence for ellagic acid detection based on surface structure of gold nanoparticles,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04792-7,Research Paper,21 June 2023,"Ellagic acid (EA), as a natural polyphenolic acid, is considered a naturally occurring inhibitor of carcinogenesis. Herein, we developed a plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) probe for EA detection based on silica-coated gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A silica shell was designed to control the distance between silica quantum dots (Si QDs) and Au NPs. The experimental results indicated that an 8.8-fold fluorescence enhancement was obtained compared with the original Si QDs. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulations further demonstrated that the local electric field enhancement around Au NPs led to the fluorescence enhancement. In addition, the fluorescent sensor was applied for the sensitive detection of EA with a detection limit of 0.14 μM. It can be used to detect EA in pomegranate rind with a recovery rate of 100.26–107.93%. It can also be applied to the analysis of other substances by changing the identification substances. These experimental results indicated that the probe provides a good option for clinical analysis and food safety."
A sensitive electrochemical aptasensor for zearalenone detection based on target-triggered branched hybridization chain reaction and exonuclease I–assisted recycling,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04797-2,Research Paper,16 June 2023,"Traditional methods for detecting antibiotic and mycotoxin residues rely on large-scale instruments, which are expensive and require complex sample pretreatment processes and professional operators. Although aptamer-based electrochemical sensors have the advantages of simplicity, speed, low cost, and high sensitivity, most aptamer-based sensors lack a signal amplification strategy due to their direct use of aptamers as probes, resulting in insufficient sensitivity. To solve the sensitivity problem in the electrochemical detection process, a novel electrochemical sensing strategy was established for ultrasensitive zearalenone (ZEN) detection on the basis of exonuclease I (Exo I) and branched hybridization chain reaction (bHCR) to amplify the signal. The amplification strategy showed excellent analytical performance towards ZEN with a low detection limit at 3.1×10−12 mol/L and a wide linear range from 10−11 to 10−6 mol/L. Importantly, the assay was utilized in the corn powder samples with satisfactory results, holding promising applications in food safety detection and environmental monitoring."
Dynamic in situ growth of bonded-phase silica nanospheres on silica capillary inner walls for open-tubular liquid chromatography,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04798-1,Research Paper,23 June 2023,"Silica nanospheres (SNS) were grown on the inner walls of silica capillaries through a dynamic in situ nucleation process to prepare a highly porous and large accessible surface area substrate. The SNS were then functionalized with octadecyl (C18), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and amino groups to develop robust and efficient chromatographic stationary phases. The modified silica capillaries were exploited for open-tubular liquid chromatography (OT-LC) and open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) applications. The prepared stationary phases were compared to conventional capillaries in terms of separation performance. The synthesis process was optimized, and the bonded-phase stationary phases were characterized by the electron microscopy technique. The effects of different solvents, additives, and functional groups on the geometry and chromatographic resolving power of the SNS were envisaged. The capillaries modified with octadecyl groups were evaluated for the separation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phenones, alkenylbenzenes, and enantiomers of chlorophenoxy herbicides. As an application instance, an SNS-C18-coated capillary was utilized for the separation of alkenylbenzenes from clove extract and protein digest medium, through OT-LC and OT-CEC techniques, respectively. The β-CD functionalized capillary was applied for the OT-CEC separation of a dichlorprop racemic mixture."

In this study, a novel dual-channel immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on improved up-conversion nanoparticles (IUCNPs) was developed for rapidly detecting aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and zearalenone (ZEN). The synthesized IUCNPs doped by 30% Lu3+ showed a larger size, more regular structure, and brighter fluorescence intensity than conventional UCNPs. The limits of detection (LODs) of single-channel ICA test strips for AFB1 and ZEN detection were 0.01 and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. After the optimization, the dual-channel ICA of AFB1 and ZEN in 10 min was conducted, resulting in low detection limits of 0.025 and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. Moreover, the built assay was revealed to be highly specific for six other food-contaminated mycotoxins, and exhibited excellent accuracy, with corresponding R2 of 0.9931 and 0.9982 in calibration curves, respectively. Long-term storage experiments indicated that the dual-channel test strips had superior stability and precision. The LODs of AFB1 and ZEN in spiked maize were 0.025 and 0.25 μg/kg, demonstrating great sensitivity and matrix tolerance. Furthermore, the IUNCP-ICA was validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, and a satisfactory consistency was obtained in 15 natural maize samples. Thus, the IUCNPs-ICA proposed in this work realized rapid and sensitive detection of AFB1 and ZEN, providing broad application potential in on-site screening for multiple mycotoxins in agricultural products."

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a vital role in regulating various cellular functions. In the current study, a fluorescent probe, HCyB, based on hemicyanine and arylboronate structures, was designed to detect H2O2. HCyB reacted with H2O2 and exhibited a good linear relationship for H2O2 concentrations ranging from 15 to 50 μM and good selectivity over other species. The fluorescent detection limit was 76 nM. Moreover, HCyB exhibited less toxicity and mitochondrial-targeting abilities. HCyB was successfully used to monitor exogenous or endogenous H2O2 in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7, human skin fibroblast WS1, breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231, and human leukemia monocytic THP1 cells."
"Fast profiling of primary, secondary, conjugated, and sulfated bile acids in human urine and murine feces samples","August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04802-8,Research Paper,20 June 2023,"Bile acids (BAs) are a complex class of metabolites that have been described as specific biomarkers of gut microbiota activity. The development of analytical methods allowing the quantification of an ample spectrum of BAs in different biological matrices is needed to enable a wider implementation of BAs as complementary measures in studies investigating the functional role of the gut microbiota. This work presents results from the validation of a targeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of 28 BAs and six sulfated BAs, covering primary, secondary, and conjugated BAs. The analysis of 73 urine and 20 feces samples was used to test the applicability of the method. Concentrations of BAs in human urine and murine feces were reported, ranging from 0.5 to 50 nmol/g creatinine and from 0.012 to 332 nmol/g, respectively. Seventy-nine percent of BAs present in human urine samples corresponded to secondary conjugated BAs, while 69% of BAs present in murine feces corresponded to primary conjugated BAs. Glycocholic acid sulfate (GCA-S) was the most abundant BA in human urine samples, while taurolithocholic acid was the lowest concentrated compound detected. In murine feces, the most abundant BAs were α-murocholic, deoxycholic, dehydrocholic, and β-murocholic acids, while GCA-S was the lowest concentrated BA. The presented method is a non-invasive approach for the simultaneous assessment of BAs and sulfated BAs in urine and feces samples, and the results will serve as a knowledge base for future translational studies focusing on the role of the microbiota in health."
Rapid detection of Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 based on a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (cLAMP) assay using a molecular beacon paired with HRPzyme,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04803-7,Research Paper,27 June 2023,"Contamination by Escherichia coli O157:H7 is considered a threat in the livestock and food industries. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for the convenient and rapid detection of Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7. This study aimed to develop a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (cLAMP) assay using a molecular beacon to rapidly detect E. coli O157:H7. Primers and a molecular beacon were designed for targeting the Shiga-toxin-producing virulence genes (stx1 and stx2) as molecular markers. Additionally, Bst polymerase concentration and amplification conditions for bacterial detection were optimized. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were also investigated and validated on artificially tainted (100–104 CFU/g) Korean beef samples. The cLAMP assay could detect 1 × 101 CFU/g at 65 °C for both genes, and the assay was confirmed to be specific for E. coli O157:H7. The cLAMP takes about an hour and does not require expensive devices (e.g., thermal cycler and detector). Hence, the cLAMP assay proposed herein can be used in the meat industry as a fast and simple way to detect E. coli O157:H7."
Polypyrrole/carbon dot nanocomposite as an electrochemical biosensor for liquid biopsy analysis of tryptophan in the human serum of normal and breast cancer women,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04784-7,Research Paper,04 July 2023,"Liquid biopsy analysis represents a suitable alternative analysis procedure in several cases where no tumor tissue is available or in poor patient conditions. Amino acids can play a crucial role in aiding cancer diagnosis. Monitoring of tryptophan (Trp) catabolism can aid in tracking cancer progression. Therefore, a novel nanocomposite was fabricated using overoxidized polypyrrole film doped with nano-carbon dots (nano-CDs) on the pencil graphite electrode (PGE) surface for sensitive evaluation of Trp in human serum. Using square wave voltammetry (SWV), the overoxidized polypyrrole/carbon dots/pencil graphite electrode (Ov-Ox PPy/CDs/PGE) achieved excellent electrochemical catalytic activity for evaluating Trp. The modified electrode, known as Ov-Ox PPy/CDs/PGE, demonstrated superior electrochemical catalytic activity compared to bare PGE, CDs/PGE, PPy/PGE, and PPy/CDs/PGE for evaluation of Trp. The method’s excellent sensitivity was confirmed by the low limits of detection (LOD = 0.003 μmol L−1) and limit of quantitation (LOQ = 0.009 μmol L−1). The biosensor that was developed can measure tryptophan (Trp) levels in the serum of both healthy individuals and female breast cancer patients with high accuracy and sensitivity. The results indicate that there is a significant difference, as shown by the F-test, between healthy individuals and those with breast cancer. This suggests that Trp amino acid could be an essential biomarker for cancer diagnosis. Consequently, liquid biopsy analysis presents a valuable opportunity for early disease detection, particularly for cancer."
Development and validation of an eco-compatible UV–Vis spectrophotometric method for the determination of Cu2+ in aqueous matrices,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04785-6,Research Paper,14 June 2023,"Cu2+ are ubiquitous ions in the ecosystem and are responsible of serious environmental pollution. Indeed, the development of sensitive methods for Cu2+ detection is an urgent demand. In this work, we proposed a new spectrophotometric method for Cu2+ determination in different water matrices (distilled water, drinking water, wastewater, and river water). The method employs a bio-based organic ligand namely tetrasodium iminodisuccinate (IDS) able to form a stable complex with the analyte with a maximum absorption at 710 nm. Within the linear range of 6.3–381 mg L−1, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be as 1.43 mg L−1. Moreover, the recovery data of the spiked analysis of drinking/river/wastewater water samples were also satisfactory and verified the feasibility of the method for the analysis of Cu2+ in natural conditions. Finally, the AGREE assessment tool was used for a quantitative evaluation of the proposed method and reference method, in agreement with the green analytical chemistry principles. The results showed the lower environmental impact of the proposed method and the suitability of this novel approach for Cu2+ in water matrices."
Molecularly imprinted thermosensitive probe based on fluorescent advanced glycation end products to detect α-dicarbonyl compounds and inhibit pyrraline formation,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04787-4,Research Paper,21 June 2023,"A thermal-sensitive molecularly imprinted optosensing probe based on fluorescent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) was prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Carbon dots (CDs) derived from fluorescent AGEs were used as the luminous centers, while molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were wrapped outside of the CDs to form specific target recognition sites to highly selectively adsorb the intermediate product of AGEs of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG). Thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was combined with acrylamide (AM) as co-functional monomers, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was chosen as a cross-linker for targeting identification and detection of 3-DG. Under optimal conditions, the fluorescence of MIPs could be gradually quenched with the adsorption of 3-DG on the surface of MIPs in the linear range of 1–160 μg/L, and the detection limit was 0.31 μg/L. The spiked recoveries of MIPs ranged from 82.97 to 109.94% in two milk samples, and the relative standard deviations were all less than 1.8%. In addition, the inhibition rate for non-fluorescent AGEs of pyrraline (PRL) was 23% by adsorbing 3-DG in the simulated milk system of casein and d-glucose, indicating that temperature-responsive MIPs not only could detect the dicarbonyl compound 3-DG quickly and sensitively, but also had an excellent inhibitory effect on AGEs."

Sanitary and analytical control programs are developed to detect the occurrence of these toxins in seafood before they reach toxic levels. To ensure quick results, methods must be easy and fast to perform. In this work, we demonstrated that incurred samples were a viable alternative to validation and internal quality control studies for the analysis of LMBs in bivalve mollusks. These samples were used to optimize, validate, and monitor a simple and fast ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) procedure. An internal quality control material containing okadaic acid (227 ± 46 µg kg−1) was produced and characterized. This material had its homogeneity and stability verified and was included as a quality control in all batches of analytical routine. Besides, a sample pooling protocol for extracts analysis was developed, based on tests for COVID-19. Up to 10 samples could be analyzed simultaneously, reducing the instrumental time of analysis by up to 80%. The UAE and sample pooling approaches were then applied to more than 450 samples, of which at least 100 were positive for the okadaic acid group of toxins."
Synthesis of a novel isotopically labelled standard for quantification of γ-nonalactone in New Zealand Pinot noir via SIDA-SPE-GC–MS,"August 2023, issue 20",/journal/216/volumes-and-issues/415-20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-04789-2,Research Paper,13 June 2023,"γ-Nonalactone is a linear aliphatic lactone ubiquitous in wine, associated with coconut, sweet, and stone fruit aroma descriptors. Little research has been conducted looking at the importance of this compound to New Zealand (NZ) wine aroma. 2H213C2-γ-Nonalactone, a novel isotopologue of γ-nonalactone, was synthesised in this work for use in a stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) for quantification of γ-nonalactone in NZ Pinot noir wines for the first time. Synthesis was carried out using heptaldehyde as the starting material, and 13C atoms and 2H atoms were introduced via Wittig olefination and deuterogenation steps, respectively. The suitability of this compound as an internal standard was demonstrated by spiking model wine at normal and elevated conditions during sample preparation, with subsequent analysis via mass spectrometry showing stability of 2H213C2-γ-nonalactone. A model wine calibration, with concentrations of γ-nonalactone from 0 to 100 µg L−1, was shown to have excellent linearity (R2 > 0.99), reproducibility (0.72%), and repeatability (0.38%). Twelve NZ Pinot noir wines, representative of a range of NZ Pinot noir–producing regions, prices, and vintages, were analysed by solid-phase extraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPE-GC–MS). The concentrations of γ-nonalactone ranged from 8.3 to 22.5 µg L−1, the latter of which was close to the odour detection threshold of this compound. These findings provide a basis for further research into γ-nonalactone and its impact on NZ Pinot noir aroma and provide a robust method for the quantification of this compound in Pinot noir."
