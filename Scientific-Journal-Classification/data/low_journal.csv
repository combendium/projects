Liquid–Liquid Extraction of Organic Compounds into a Single Drop of the Extractant: Overview of Reviews,"August 2021, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821080049,"('REVIEWS',)",29 July 2021,"Single-drop microextraction (SDME) and hollow-fiber membrane microextraction (HFME) belong to methods of the liquid-phase microextraction preconcentration of organic compounds. These methods are characterized by the low consumption of organic solvents, high preconcentration factors, simplicity, low cost, ease of combination with various chromatographic methods; processes of preconcentration and sample injection are combined in a single device. Since the emergence of SDME (1996) and HFME (1999), a large number of versions have been developed that differ in the preconcentration technique, nature of the extractants used, and combinations with methods for the subsequent determination of the preconcentrated substances. The popularity of these methods among the analysts is evidenced by many reviews that we have summarized in this publication."
"Determination of Lanthanides in Coal Fly Ash, Sediment and Monazite Sand by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry After Separation Using Oxalate form of Ion-Exchange Resin","February 2021, issue 2",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821020155,"('ARTICLES',)",23 February 2021,"A method has been developed for the separation of lanthanides, Ce, Nd, Gd, La, Pr, Sm, Dy, Eu, Er, Ho, Yb, Tm, Tb and Lu, using oxalate form of Dowex-1, a reactive ion-exchanger. Lanthanides present in such samples as monazite sand, coal fly ash and sediment were separated from matrix at pH 2.5 in a column containing oxalate form of Dowex-1 resin. The samples have been decomposed in H2SO4 and taken in 0.36 M H2SO4 prior to separation. The lanthanides in the column were eluted with 2 M HNO3. Lanthanides present in the eluent were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP−OES) and the recovery of analytes ranged from 92 to 105%. Matrix free solutions were analyzed for lanthanides by ICP−OES. The relative standard deviation was in the range of 4–7% and limits of detection were between 0.015–0.16 mg/kg. The developed procedure was applied to the separation and determination of lanthanides in a standard reference material NIST Coal Fly Ash 1633b, a lake sediment and monazite sand. The results obtained by the present method are in close agreement with certified values in case of certified reference material and microwave digestion method for other samples. Accuracy of other samples is ensured based on standard addition recoveries."
"Application of Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization to the Determination of 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine Transformation Products by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry","December 2020, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/75-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934820130109,"('ARTICLES',)",20 December 2020,"The behavior of eight nitrogen-containing toxic products of rocket fuel transformation (formaldehyde dimethylhydrazone, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylguanidine, 1,2,4-triazole, pyridine, imidazole, pyrazine, pyrazole) under conditions of dopant-free atmospheric pressure photoionization was studied. It was found that the analytes under study give intense signals of protonated molecules, while the efficiency of ionization largely depends on temperature, as well as on the solvent composition and flow rate. Based on a combination of atmospheric pressure photoionization with chromatographic separation on porous graphitized carbon, we proposed a new approach to the highly sensitive determination of rocket fuel transformation products. The developed approach is distinguished by minimal matrix interferences and was successfully tested in the analysis of real samples."
Simultaneous Determination of Sulfur Mustard Adducts with Guanine and Acetylcysteine in Urine by High-Resolution High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry,"August 2020, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/75-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934820060155,"('ARTICLES',)",31 July 2020,"We propose a procedure for the simultaneous determination of biomarkers of the action of sulfur mustard (SM, 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide), namely, a depurinized adduct with DNA (N7-hydroxyethylthioethyl guanine) and an adduct with acetylcysteine (ACC) (1,1'-sulfonylbis[2-S-(N-acetylcysteinyl)ethane]), in urine by high-resolution HPLC–tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. The limit of quantification reached for both analytes is 10 ng/mL. The calibration plots are linear in the range 10–200 ng/mL. The procedure was tested in the analysis of urine samples obtained after the subcutaneous administration of sulfur mustard to rats in nonlethal dose (2 mg/kg) both in the absence of therapy and in using ACC as a scavenger (antidote). The positive effect of ACC therapy on the kinetics of sulfur mustard excretion from a body in the first hours after poisoning was found at the molecular level for the first time, and the protective effect of ACC on DNA in case of damage with sulfur mustard was substantiated."

However, because of the growing complexity of the mass spectrometers employed in these studies, there is an increasing need in robust and rapid quality control over the instrument performance. A variety of quality control tools targeting all aspects of LC–MS instrument operation have been developed recently. These tools are typically loaded heavily with a large number of metrics. Many of these metrics are difficult for interpretation for regular users without extensive instrumentation and/or data processing experience. In this work, we introduced a set of simple and intuitively understandable metrics for assessing the quality of proteomic analysis, including the total experimental time and the number of spectral scans, ion accumulation time and intensity in both MS and MS/MS spectra, charge state distribution for precursor peptide ions, and the number of sequential MS/MS scans, etc. These metrics are implemented as an open-source utility, viQC, freely available at hg.theorchromo.ru/viQC. The developed tool has been tested experimentally using data from three different Orbitrap instruments and demonstrated its capability for assessing the possible flaws in the instrument’s operation and subsequent improving the efficiency of proteomic analysis."
On the Correct Averaging of the Equations of Ion Motion in High-Frequency Electric Fields,"December 2019, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193481914003X,"('ARTICLES',)",30 December 2019,"The pseudopotential approach is a useful tool for the qualitative description of ion motion in inhomogeneous high-frequency electric fields, often used in mass spectrometric devices. However, in the theoretical study of the motion of ions in high-frequency electric fields with close frequencies, mathematical ambiguity arises, caused by the nonequivalence of different mathematical approaches. The paper considers and compares the time-dependent pseudopotential model and the model of solenoidal (vortex) pseudoforces, that is, vortex drift. The vortex drift model in high-frequency electric fields with close frequencies can be replaced by the model of ion motion in a pseudopotential varying in time. The theory of almost periodic time signals with two characteristic time scales, fast and slow, eliminates the ambiguity in selecting the correct mathematical method for describing ion motion in high-frequency electric fields."
Quadrupole Ion Trap Time-of-Flight MALDI Mass Spectrometry: Hydration of Ions of Hydroxyl-Containing Compounds,"December 2019, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819140053,"('ARTICLES',)",30 December 2019,"A possibility of artifact formation associated with ion hydration in quadrupole ion trap MALDI mass spectra is shown for the first time on an example of a number of natural hydroxyl-containing compounds from various classes. It was found that, in using tandem mass spectrometry, both precursor ions and product ions are involved in the formation of adducts with water. The main source of water for ion-molecular interactions in the ion trap is provided by buffer and collision gases. The role of metal cations in the formation of analyte adducts with water is noted. For the majority of the studied hydroxyl-containing compounds, hydration proceeds most actively in cationization with lithium ions, with the peak of the [M+H2O+Li]+ ion dominating in the mass spectra."

It was shown that 1,4-dibromobutane and 1,2-xylylene dibromide are the most effective alkylating agents, providing the formation of a stable five-membered ring with a positively charged sulfur atom. Such cations are readily detected by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Sulfonium cations were further studied by tandem mass spectrometry using collision-induced dissociation (CID). Typical and specific CID directions for cyclic cations formed from thiols of different structures are revealed.

The study of tandem mass spectra and of a composition of monomers formed in the collision-induced dissociation of lignin macromolecules showed the special role of p-hydroxycinnamic acids in the formation of nettle lignin. Based on the results of tandem mass spectrometry, possible structures of nettle lignin oligomers formed by the addition of guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units followed by etherification by p-coumaric, ferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are proposed."
"Gas-Chromatographic Retention Indices in GC/MS Identification of Alkyl Dichlorophosphates, Dialkyl Chlorophosphates, and Their Thio Analogues","December 2019, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819140120,"('ARTICLES',)",30 December 2019,"The determination of a series of analytical parameters for the gas-chromatographic/mass-spectrometric identification of reactive intermediate products of phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) and thiophosphoryl chrolide (PSCl3) interaction with aliphatic alcohols, O-alkyl dichlorophosphates (I), O,O-dialkyl chlorophosphates (II), O-alkyl dichlorothiophosphates (III), and O,O-dialkyl chlorothiophosphates (IV) is considered. The members of these series are not sufficiently presented in contemporary databases; an exception is provided by series (I) and (II), which are characterized with EI mass spectra (NIST MS Database, 2017) for 8 and 19 homologues, respectively. The data set includes EI mass spectra and gas-chromatographic retention indices (RI) on standard nonpolar polydimethylsiloxane stationary phases. Strong differences in the mass spectra of homologues of series (I) depending on the conditions of their registration are revealed. A comparison of RI values for alkyl chlorophosphates and thiophosphates allows the evaluation of increments for the hypothetic substitution of the oxygen atom in the P=O fragment with the sulfur atom (P=S), namely 59 ± 4 and 30 ± 4 for O-alkyl dichloro- and O,O-dialkyl chloroderivatives. The statistical processing of the so-called homologous increments of retention indices leads to average values attributed to a homologous series rather than to individual homologues. Using these values permitted us to evaluate the molecular weights of homologues for which no reliably detected signals of molecular ions are present in EI mass spectra."

By the developed technique, the sample analysis of rat blood plasma was carried out after the introduction of PPI pharmaceutical substance in a dose of 20 mg/kg, a pharmacokinetic profile of the substance was established, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in order to judge the degrees and rates of absorption and excretion of the new antiulcer drug in the blood of laboratory rats."
On the Issue of Informativeness of Mass Spectral Diagnostic Relations and Criteria Based on Them for Testing Geochemical Hypotheses,"December 2019, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819140107,"('ARTICLES',)",30 December 2019,"The quantitative evaluation of the errors of the 1st and 2nd kind for mass spectral criteria is obtained. These errors have been earlier proposed for distinguishing oils generated in carbonate and other rocks for the Domanic formation of the northern and central Volga−Ural regions. It is shown that none of them work: the best criteria have the 1st and 2nd kind errors close to 50%. Consequently, for all regions where carbonate oil source rocks are possible, a work similar to this should be done primarily, and only after such study, the analysis of oils becomes meaningful. It is also necessary to obtain quantitative estimates of the quality of all the other criteria used in petroleum geochemistry, for which such assessments are technically possible. New criteria should be designed only on the basis of those composition parameters for which the value of the Mann–Whitney test is close to zero."

The main of these reasons is an anomalously large scatter of the initial data. It can be due to either the low reproducibility of the characteristics of substances, their quantities, analytical signal intensities, process conditions, etc., or variability due to differences in the nature of the objects themselves. In the latter case, the nature of data interpretation is influenced by analytical hypotheses adopted for their consideration. The tasks considered include variations in the component composition of developers for black-and-white negative photographic materials, comparison of temperature parameters of the gas-chromatographic separation of various organic compounds, toxicity characterization (LD50) of homologues using C3–C12 1-alkanols as an example, and the possibility of predicting sample preparation operations in the determination of drugs in blood plasma based on their physicochemical characteristics. The main features of data interpretation characterized by a high degree of uncertainty are revealed. It is noted that important conclusions can be drawn based on the facts of low reproducibility (one-dimensional arrays) or poor correlation of variables (two-dimensional arrays)."

For the extraction method, the linear regression was y = 0.0375x – 0.0007, and the coefficient of determination (r2) was 0.9995. The limit of detection (LOD) was 9 µg/L, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 28 µg/L. The assay recovery was 83 ± 6%, and the intermediate precision (relative standard deviation (RSD), %) was 2.3%. For the method including sorption onto an ion exchange resin, the linear regression was y = 0.0391x – 0.0001, and the coefficient of determination (r2) was 0.9995. The LOD and LOQ were 7 and 25 µg/L, respectively. The assay recovery was 99 ± 6%, and the intermediate precision (RSD) was 2.2%. Sorption onto an ion exchange resin is simple and precise and offers higher recovery compared to the extraction method for Ni quantification.

Spectrometric Determination of the Total Concentration of Similar Analytes Using Inverted Multivariate Calibrations,"November 2022, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822110156,ARTICLES,12 November 2022,"Inverted multivariate calibration methods are used for the spectrometric determination of the total concentration (cΣ) of substances of the same type in environmental samples and food products. They represent сΣ as a sum of generalized signals (Aj), measured at different wavelengths (λj) and multiplied by corresponding regression coefficients (kj). The values of kj are found using chemometric algorithms based on the absorption spectra of mixtures of the known composition included in the training set. At the additive absorbance of mixtures, this method of group analysis gives rather accurate results. The ability of determining the total concentration of analytes with nonadditive absorbance in this way is unobvious; this case has not been studied. The aim of this study was to test the applicability of inverted calibrations for the nonadditive absorbance of analytes. Mixtures of complex compounds of Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, and Pb with the photometric reagent 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) were used as model samples. Aqueous solutions of these complexes at pH 10 have rather similar absorption spectra with maxima at 490–530 nm. In the absorption spectra of many solutions containing ions of these metals and an excess of PAR, we observed statistically significant (up to 30 rel %) positive deviations from additivity. To construct an inverted calibration, 14 mixtures with a known total metal concentration (сΣ from 8 to 25 µmol/L) were used; their absorbance was measured at six wavelengths. The least-squares estimates of regression coefficients were found using the Microsoft Excel software. Based on the resulting calibration, the cΣ values were calculated for mixtures of test samples. Relative errors in determining сΣ did not exceed 8 rel % at RSD < 4%, and the systematic errors were statistically insignificant. A further increase in the number of analytical wavelengths and the size of the training set did not decrease the errors significantly. Thus, inverted calibrations are applicable to the determination of the total concentrations of similar substances with both additive and nonadditive absorbances of the sample."

The newly formed MMT-DMA complex showed characteristic absorbance maximum at 354 nm. The spectroscopic estimation was achieved by scanning the spectrum between 200 and 800 nm on Shimadzu UV-1900 spectrophotometer.

The method was used for SPEC quantification in the concentration range of 0.7–30 ng/mL with the limit of quantitation equal to 0.5 ng/mL and the limit of detection of 0.19 ng/mL. The fluorescence of AgNPs was quenched via a gradual increase in SPEC concentration.

In addition, the sensitivity of 28Si+ was 2-fold improved by CH4 modifier that was introduced to the ICP plasma at 2 mL/min, and the background signal was decreased to 60%. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of quantification was 5 μg/L, and the reproducibility (RSD) was generally less than 3%. The proposed method was assessed using surface water standard reference materials, and the measured values agreed well with the certified values."

A comparative analysis of the results of the determination of phenolic compounds using conventional analytical derivatization in solution and solid-phase analytical derivatization in aqueous extracts of St. John’s wort showed that the preparation of derivatives on an adsorbent shortens sample preparation, minimizes the volume of the extract, and expands the list of components to be determined. We found the optimal conditions for the adsorption of phenolic substances from aqueous extracts on the Strata C18-E adsorbent and solid-phase analytical derivatization with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometric characteristics were determined to identify compounds in the St. John’s wort aqueous extract. The results of the identification of compounds satisfactory agree with the HPLC–DAD data obtained using standard substances, allowing a conclusion that the solid-phase analytical derivatization of phenolic compounds is comparable in analytical capabilities to derivatization in solution."
Control of the Conditions of the Completeness of the Mineralization (Sample Preparation) of Biomonitor Moss Samples in the Determination of Heavy Metals Entering Them in Transboundary Transfer from Atmospheric Air,"November 2022, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822110089,ARTICLES,12 November 2022,The work deals with the selection of conditions for the preparation of biomonitor mosses using a microwave decomposition system for the determination of heavy metals entering them during transboundary transfer from atmospheric air.

Photonic crystals capable of reflecting a narrow band of visible radiation are among many ordered nanostructures, used in optics, electronics, nanotechnology, and chemical analysis. A slight impact on photonic crystals at the macro level brings to significant changes at the micro level. This property formed a basis for the creation of selective sensors for rapid analysis. The creation of sensor matrices based on photonic crystals comprises three main stages: the formation of ordered structures, imparting specific properties to them, and recording and interpretating an analytical signal. Such an integrated approach results in sensor devices that enable the real-time determination of the concentrations of targets of various nature: from ions and small molecules to proteins and cells."

Two sets of reaction and determination conditions were developed. The first set was based on reaction of Cu(II) and Pb(II) with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol reagent in alkaline media and using derivative ratio spectrophotometry for the simultaneous determination of Cu(II) and Pb(II) by measuring the peak intensities at 539 and 543 nm, respectively.

The amounts of CuR2 and total lead can be determined by derivative ratio spectrophotometry. So, according to the obtained data for resorcylic acid, CuR2, and total lead by derivative ratio spectrophotometry, the amounts of PbR2 and PbO were determined by applying stoichiometric equations. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of CuR2, PbR2, and PbO in DB propellants. The results of the method were statistically compared based on t- and F-tests with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The results showed that the proposed method offers an accurate and reliable approach for the determination of these compounds in DB propellants and can be suggested as a routine method in military quality control laboratories."

It is found that the interaction of silver triangular nanoplates with L-ascorbic acid in the presence of silver(I) nitrate is accompanied by a bathochromic shift and an increase in the intensity of the surface plasmon resonance band of nanoparticles, which can be used as the basis for methods for determining reductants. The proposed interaction mechanism includes the reduction of Ag+ ions to metallic silver under the action of an analyte and its deposition on the surface of nanoparticle seeds.

The present study focuses on the use of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) modified gold nanoparticles (PAuNPs) as a sensing platform for UA detection making it an attractive alternative to the existing technique involving elaborate instrumentation. PAuNPs were prepared by irradiation of chloroauric acid and PTA by UV light. The binding of PAuNPs with UA was characterized by a visible color change of the solution followed by the red shift in the plasmon absorption band. The basic principle applied here is the formation of allantoin and carbon dioxide by the reaction between PTA and UA. The method shows linearity between 1.7–14 mg/dL with the detection limit of 1.2 mg/dL. The color change and the variation in the absorbance of PAuNPs were highly specific for UA in the presence of other major interferents. The method was successfully applied for the detection of UA in real samples of urine and blood. The method is very simple and could be adopted by any person, which enables patients to have a self-checking method at home before seeking medical attention. This type of sensing kit would be highly beneficial in rural health care centers, where high-tech diagnostic tests are unavailable for most people."

The analytes were detected using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The stepwise gradient of formic acid without an addition of an organic solvent made it possible to achieve good resolution of the analyte peaks and decrease the limits of detection by a factor of 4.4–17.8 compared to their separation with 0.1% formic acid under isocratic conditions. The effect of methanol on the separation of analytes is less pronounced.

The Role of GC-EI-MS and Derivatization in the Detection of New Psychoactive Substances Exemplified by 49 Synthetic Cathinones,"October 2022, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193482210015X,ARTICLES,07 October 2022,"Synthetic cathinones (SC) continue to represent the second largest group of substances on the drug market among new psychoactive substances (NPS). They have gained their fame mainly due to their amphetamine-like effects. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction currently monitors over 830 NPS among which 156 are synthetic cathinone derivatives. The constant introduction of new derivatives often makes their identification in the examined evidence much more difficult. This is most often caused by the presence of isomers within the same group of substances as well as SC with similar chemical structures. Gas chromatography coupled to electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS) is the gold standard in their toxicological analysis. The aim of this study was to analyze 49 certified NPS standards from the SC group in the parent form and/or acetyl or trimethylsilyl derivatives by GC-EI-MS and to characterize their electron mass spectra. Additionally, an integrated application with the MassHunter software was used to create an authors’ library of SC including such parameters as retention times and mass spectra. The developed method allowed to achieve chromatographic separation of derivatives within a given group of positional isomers and SC with similar chemical structures. In the case of chloromethcathinone isomers, trimethylsilylation was necessary to achieve complete separation of these derivatives. The analysis of mass spectra of acetyl derivatives of SC allowed for their classification depending on the presence of characteristic m/z values. The obtained data allowed for the development of an automated library of mass spectra of these compounds with application potential for the purposes of forensic toxicology."

In this study, an untargeted metabolomic approach using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-ToF-MS) was used to classify E. longifolia samples and to determine metabolite variations in 1-, 4-, and 11-year-old E. longifolia roots collected from different planting locations. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis showed clear separation between hairy root culture and E. longifolia root samples, highlighting apparent metabolite differences between these samples. Moreover, the approach successfully separated E. longifolia root samples according to their harvesting age and planting location. The PCA loading plot after varimax rotation revealed that dominant ions with strong loadings to principal component 1 were identified as canthin-6-one alkaloid and quassinoid compounds. Overall, the findings indicate that HPLC-Q-ToF-MS-based metabolomics is a powerful approach to classify and determine metabolite variations in E. longifolia samples."
Uncertainty of the Results of Electron Probe Microanalysis using a Spectrometer with Wavelength Dispersion in the Study of Geological Samples,"October 2022, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822100094,ARTICLES,07 October 2022,"In this paper, we presented a detailed study on the effect of electron beam diameter, spectral overlapping, and element assay sequence on quantitative uncertainties of electron probe microanalysis. With a fixed electron beam diameter of 1 μm for external standard materials, the sample signal intensities were found to decline with the increasing electron beam diameter from 1 to 300 μm, resulting in a sample concentration bias higher than 2% and even up to 20%. Only when electron beam diameter difference between external standard materials and analyzed samples was less than 20 μm, the concentration bias was negligible. The spectral overlapping interference investigation revealed that in the case of shoulder-peak overlapping it was possible to remove the concentration bias by appropriately choosing L value and background signal picking-up position. However, quantification calibration was mandatory when there existed on-peak spectral overlapping interference. For sphalerite samples, this effect was prominent, and the artificially produced Na2O concentration can be 6.23% (±0.30%, 2σ, n = 12) due to on-peak spectral interference of Zn on Na. Furthermore, because of the on-peak spectral interference of S on Mo, the quantification accuracy of Mo was found to be dependent on the mass fraction of S in the studied samples. We also observed that element assay sequence highly affected the quantification accuracy of geological samples containing alkali. In element composition analysis of albite samples, when using matrix-matched calibration standard, the average Na2O concentration decreased substantially from 11.55 to 5.61% when Na was measured the first and last, respectively."

The determination of gold also has an environmental aspect, because this metal was recognized an allergen. In the present work, over 80 samples of Moscow Urban dust were studied using complementary analytical methods: inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In some samples, the concentration of gold exceeded 1 µg/g and even reached 30–35 µg/g. Gold is present in the dust as microparticles no larger than 2–3 µm in size. The high concentration of gold in particles (about 99%) virtually excludes jewelry as its source. The study of the sampling map suggests that, with a high probability, the main anthropogenic source of gold in Moscow Urban dust is the gradual wear of church domes covered with high-grade gold leaf."

This paper presents a review of reagents and analytes suitable for turn-on fluorescence analysis and assesses the potentials of the method in chemical and biochemical analysis, including for studying real samples of complex chemical composition. Not all effects grouped under the name turn-on fluorescence are qualitatively new; one of the goals of this work was to harmonize the terms used in modern English-language publications with the terms adopted in the domestic literature on luminescence. A turn-on fluorescence reagent is a good phosphor with a structural “defect” that lowers the quantum yield, for example, an open cycle, a disruption in a system of conjugated bonds, or an attached quencher. The defect is eliminated by the reaction with the analyte, and an intensely luminescent product is formed. The types of defects and reactions for their “correction” form a basis of the proposed classification of reagents with turn-on fluorescence."

The developed method is simple, cheap, and rapid. It obeys the principle of green chemistry since n-butanol used as an extraction solvent for platinum determination in aqueous solutions was further recycled and did not release toxic wastes. Platinum forms a red-colored soluble complex with FIMMT at pH 5.4 on heating. Platinum(II)−FIMMT complex was instantly extracted into n-butanol. The complex absorbance in aqueous and n-butanol solutions was found at λmax of 510 nm. The complex was stable for more than 24 h in the presence of other ions with the extinction coefficient of 11686 L/mol ⋅ cm and Sandell’s sensitivity of 0.017 µg/cm2. The effect of pH, excess of reagent, and foreign ions on the determination of platinum as well as the influence of heating time, stability, and solubility of the complex in various solvents were studied. The system obeyed Beer’s law up to 17.5 µg/mL, and the optimum range was evaluated by Ringbom method. The developed method showed excellent linearity and a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The method is precise, and it was applied for platinum determination in synthetic matrices, real samples such as cis-platin injection and platinum–rhodium thermocouple wire. The chromogenic reagent FIMMT selectively reacts with nickel, palladium, and platinum, which helps to separate them quantitatively."

However, the excess of these ions contaminates foods and causes many kinds of diseases. In recent years, designing chemosensors for detection of the two targets has been widespread but is still a great challenge for practical application. In this study, by reducing expenses, simplifying analytical procedures, and enabling multifunctions, a functional chemosensor was proposed by using tetraphenylethylene derivative (H4tcbpe) which could selectively and sensitively response to Zn2+ and Cu2+. H4tcbpe can be used to detect Zn2+ with fluorescence enhancement based on aggregation induced emission effect, while fluorescence of H4tcbpe can be quenched by Cu2+ due to the disassembly of H4tcbpe aggregates in a solvent/nonsolvent binary mixture of EtOH and H2O. Fluorophotometry, UV-Vis, and SEM were used to characterize behavior of the fluorescence sensor. In this work, the detection in liquid solutions was conducted, and a fluorescent test pen for the assay of Zn2+ and Cu2+ on a piece of filter paper was fabricated. The proposed fluorescent test pen contained H4tcbpe as a “fluorescent probe ink” and made it possible to write words on the area of a filter paper spiked with solutions with different concentrations of Zn2+ and Cu2+. The detection limits for Zn2+ and Cu2+ are 43 nM and 0.5 μM, respectively. This fluorescent sensor was applied to sense ions in black fungus samples. The proposed sensor could successfully detect Zn2+ and Cu2+, and the results were in agreement with the data from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which indicated the reliability of the proposed sensor for applications in the real samples."

Cys reacted with p-nitrophenyl acrylate via Michael addition and cyclization to form p-nitrophenol (PNP) which had the UV absorption maximum at 405 nm. PNP quenched the fluorescence of CDs at the excitation wavelength of 420 nm based on inner filter effect. The fluorescence intensity change of CDs was used as an output signal for Cys detection. The probe detected Cys over homocysteine and glutathione in a solution with high selectivity.

Tracers were synthesized by the noncovalent adsorption of amitriptyline on the surface of silicate nanoparticles doped with ruthenium(II) complexes. For the practical application of the proposed method, we selected the optimal concentrations of the tracer and antibodies by dilution. The amounts of reagents were selected based on fluorescence intensity and fluorescence polarization. According to the sensitivity requirements of the tracer, a dilution of 1 : 2 was selected, the fluorescence intensity of which was ten times higher than the background value, while the optimal fluorescence polarization value was fixed at 32. The optimal dilution of antibodies, corresponding to 70% of the fluorescence polarization value from the maximum signal, was 1 : 200. The range of working concentrations of amitriptyline was 1 × 10–10–1 × 10–5 M; the lower limits of determination were at a level of (7–8) × 10–11 M. The results are promising for monitoring the concentration of amitriptyline both in the pharmaceutical preparation and biological fluids to determine the effectiveness of ongoing therapeutic treatments and for medical and forensic purposes."

At that, ions of the main component, formed as a result of atmospheric-pressure photoionization, act as a reagent substance for the desired impurities in the atmospheric pressure photochemical ionization mode. It is possible to choose conditions under which the number of peaks recorded in the mass spectrum of a mixture corresponds to the number of mixture components, and each peak corresponds to M+ or MH+ ions of the mixture component. The information obtained is the number of impurities in the test substance (in this work, in methyl methacrylate) and their integer molecular weights."

An analysis of the literature demonstrated that the most efforts of researchers were aimed at overcoming the main disadvantage of SERS as an analysis method—low selectivity, which is especially important in the case of complex objects such as biological fluids. In this regard, the main positive results in the SERS analysis of human biological fluids are currently associated with the development of procedures that minimize the level of a background signal. The procedures are based on various combinations of SERS with separation and preconcentration methods, the use of sample preparation, and the application of chemometrics to take into account the background component of an analytical signal. Significant progress is also associated with the development of multifunctional SERS-active materials, which make it possible to improve the selectivity of analysis. However, it is the analytical part of most works that is the weakest point, which requires further research, including the verification of SERS analysis procedures using control reference methods."

It is shown that the optimal extractant of free phenols from buckwheat grain is a 50% water–ethanol solution; vortexing without heating is sufficient for extraction. Using high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector, fluorescence and MS detectors, the dominant components are quantitatively determined in all buckwheat samples: rutin ((6.7–14.1) × 10–2 g/kg), flavan-3-ols (catechin (1.8–8.7) × 10–2 g/kg and epicatechin (2.5–11.6) × 10–2 g/kg). Protocatechuic and gallic acids, as well as unbound vitexin and quercetin, are detected in minor amounts mainly in heat-treated buckwheat grains. Linear correlations between the total concentration of phenolic compounds, estimated by the Folin–Ciocalteu method, and AOA, as well as between the sum of concentrations of three components (rutin, catechin, and epicatechin) and AOA are obtained.

Cherkesov and N.M. Alykov stimulated a detailed study of the effect of tautomerism on the analytical properties of reagents and their complexes. The appearance or the enhancement of an analytical effect in spectrophotometric reactions is often due to tautomerization, accompanying, in particular, protolytic equilibria. A quantum-chemical substantiation (with the explicit account of the medium) was given for the protonation of aromatic amino-azo compounds in aqueous solutions at the β-nitrogen atom of the azo group, which caused quinoidization, leading to the formation of analytical forms with intense analytical signals. Cherkesov’s works on sulphophthalexons found a continuation in substantiating the comparative stability of the heterocyclic and open zwitterionic forms of the reagent molecules. The prediction of the properties of atoms, ions, and compounds of new chemical elements, based on the development of his doctrine of periodicity, gives a key to the selection and adaptation of analytical methods. The assumption of the scientist on the relationship between the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the atom forereached the study of a possibility of nuclear-chemical transformations in nuclear ablation and the analysis of stellar nucleosynthesis. Professor Cherkesov can be considered a forerunner of the idea of E. A. Smolenski, who generalized the Pauli exclusion principle and created the method of multi-electron wavefunctions, representing a conceptually new general direction in computational quantum chemistry in comparison with the methods of molecular orbitals and valence bonds."

"Multiple Optimization for Extraction of Ethinylestradiol, Levonorgestrel, and Their Main Impurities using Mixture Design","July 2022, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822070048,ARTICLES,05 July 2022,"In pharmaceutical analysis, the development of extraction procedures focuses mainly on the optimization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, this may lead to low recovery values for impurities, which is a disadvantage for the development of stability-indicating methods to assess the expiration time of drugs in stability studies. Here, we have proposed a multiple optimization for the extraction of ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, and their main impurities aiming to develop a stability-indicating chromatographic procedure. A mixture experimental design was adopted to optimize the recovery of ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, and 32 impurities. Mixtures of acetonitrile (0 to 60%), methanol (0 to 60%), and water (40 to 80%) were used to extract the analytes from samples subjected to dry thermal degradation. Recovery values for ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel ranged between 12.5–100.0% and 47.4–100.0%, respectively. Optimal recovery values were achieved using a mixture of methanol (60%) and water (40%). The optimized extraction mixture provided significantly higher recoveries for 18 substances than the initial extraction mixture, including 10 unknown impurities. Most of these unknown impurities did not have a good recoverability. Thus, the multiple optimization of the extraction procedure exhibits great potential for application to optimize sample preparation for stability-indicating analytical procedures."

The three-parameter characteristic method uses an expression of the intermolecular interaction energy in terms of the contributions of nonpolar, polar, and hydrogen bonds in an asymptotic approximation obtained using the theory of generalized charges and a new quantum-mechanical concept of the energy and probability of hydrogen bond formation. An advantage of the method is that the parameters used in the mathematical expressions have physical meaning, are portable, and can be found without experimentation. Relationships between the characteristics of stationary phases and their structure are revealed. The selectivity map as a classification method enables gas chromatographic liquid stationary phases to be considered in the range from low polarity/low hydrophilic to high polarity/high hydrophilic phases. On the other hand, applying the principle of the similarity of properties in combination with the selectivity map ensures the selection of the most selective phase for the given analytes. This selection can be made a priori, without experimentation. An example is given of choosing a selective stationary phase for separating substances with similar properties using a selectivity map."

The most efficient combination is the conventional C18 stationary phase (Kromasil) and environmentally friendly mobile phases, in which acetonitrile is replaced by 2-propanol, with the mobile phase acidified with 0.25 vol % of phosphoric acid to stabilize the charge form of acids. The retention of dicaffeoylquinic acids can be explained by the simultaneous adsorption of caffeic acid substituents by two aromatic rings for both studied organic modifiers of the mobile phase. The replacement of the C18 phase by the phenylhexyl phase did not lead to significant changes in the selectivity of the separation of isomeric DCQ acids.

The method includes several stages: the isolation of a total RNA fraction from a bacterial culture and the production of the beta-lactamase target DNA in sequential reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction with the incorporation of a biotin label, and the hybridization of the target DNA on colorimetric biochips. Sample preparation conditions were optimized to increase the yield of the analyzed target DNA. A calibration curve for determining the amount of mRNA was constructed using a standard sample of beta-lactamase TEM-1 mRNA obtained by transcription in vitro. The advantage of using a standard sample corresponding to the full-length blaTEM-1 gene is that it passes through all the stages of analysis in parallel with the test samples with the same efficiency. The detection limit for TEM-1 beta-lactamase mRNA was 0.40 ± 0.05 amol/mL; the range of determined concentrations was from 1.0 amol/mL to 2000 fmol/mL, and the relative standard deviation did not exceed 12%. The duration of analysis after the production of a bacterial culture was about 7 h. The developed method can be used to study the conditions for the expression of beta-lactamase genes in bacteria resistant to antimicrobial drugs."

The adsorption capacity of all types of composites increases with the concentration of CNTs in them relative to MNPs. The component ratio of 10 : 1 was optimal for the composites with all CNTs obtained with various catalysts and having different morphologies. At this ratio, the composite has the maximum adsorption capacity for the studied ions, which is 6.5, 6.1, and 5.5 mg/g for Ag(I), Au(III), and Pd(II), respectively, and sufficient magnetization for phase separation in a magnetic field. The modification of CNTs with magnetic nanoparticles enables using the resulting composite in both batch and dynamic versions of solid-phase extraction; previously, individual CNTs obtained with cobalt and iron catalysts did not demonstrate proper results. In the dynamic mode, large volumes of test solutions can be used; higher preconcentration factors are achieved compared to the batch mode; lower limits of element determination are obtained after the evaporation of the eluates from the graphite powder. For all types of composites, a comparative metrological evaluation of the results of element determination by arc atomic emission spectroscopy was performed. The obtained limits of determination for elements are n × 10–7 wt % (Kpreconc = 200)."

Kinetic Spectrophotometric Method and Neural Network Model Application for the Quantitation of Epinephrine by Starch-capped AgNPs Sensor in Blood and Urine,"April 2022, issue 4",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822040074,ARTICLES,12 April 2022,"In this study, a simple, accurate, precise, rapid, economical, and highly sensitive ultraviolet spectrophotometric method has been developed for the determination of epinephrine (EP) in real samples. Although the liquid chromatographic method for measuring epinephrine has such advantages as excellent accuracy and reproducibility, it has such limitations as long-time measurement, high equipment cost. For the determination of epinephrine in the solution, we used a starch-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) sensor and a kinetic spectrophotometric method. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.01–10 µg/L. The standard deviation of 1.8% and the method detection limit of 0.023 µg/L (in 8 min at 425 nm) were obtained for the sensor at a 95% confidence level. The artificial neural network (ANN) model was used for the mean squared error (MSE) determination. The ANN model in predicting data with a linear transfer function algorithm at the output layer and tansig was helpful. Mean squared error values of 0.607, 0.515, and 0.408 corresponding to MSEANN, MSEFL, and MSEANFIS, respectively, in epinephrine determination by starch-capped AgNPs sensor were obtained. The observed outcomes confirmed the suitable recovery and very low detection limit for epinephrine. The method was used to measure epinephrine in real samples such as urine and blood and can be applied for hospital samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study applying a neural network model for the quantification of epinephrine by starch-capped AgNPs sensor in blood and urine."

In this technique, the organic solvent vapor produced in the evaporator unit is introduced into the aqueous sample by using nitrogen as a carrier gas to extract target analytes. By entering the vapor bubbles of the organic solvent into the aqueous sample, the organic solvent dissolves in water and the organic solvent concentration in water reaches supersaturation. At this time, equilibrium occurs between the dissolved organic solvent and the insoluble organic solvent, and it is collected in the conical part of the cell. Using a microliter syringe, a certain volume of the collected organic solvent is injected into the gas chromatograph. Face central composite design was used to evaluate the effect of various factors including organic solvent volume, ionic strength, evaporating gas flow rate and heated chamber temperature. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit, relative standard deviation and linear dynamic range of the method were 10 µg/L, 5.3–8.7% (n = 4) and 50–5000 µg/L, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene in real samples."

Determination of Trace Elements in Biological Fluids by Arc Atomic Emission Spectrometry,"March 2022, issue 3",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822010129,ARTICLES,31 March 2022,"Determination of macro- and trace elements in various biological fluids, including saliva and blood serum, is widely used for medical diagnostics and assessment of the impact of anthropogenic factors on human health. The most popular methods of spectral analysis have several disadvantages, including the need in sample preparation. As an alternative, we proposed a direct (without digestion) analysis of biofluids by arc atomic emission spectrometry using the dry residue method. The experimentally found optimal amount of the spectral buffer (0.15 mg of NaCl) and current strength (20 A) ensure a high-intensity analytical signal and a better limit of detection. The selected conditions also neutralize the effect of the saliva and serum matrix on the parameters of the arc plasma (temperature and electron concentration), which enables the use of standard aqueous solutions of element salts for plotting calibration curves. When 150 µL of a whole saliva sample is applied to one end of the electrode, the limits of detection are at the level of no more than 1 µg/L for Ag, Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn and several micrograms per liter for Cr, Pb, and Ti. No more than 50 µL of blood serum can be applied to the electrode end face; the limits of detection, in this case, are three times higher. We assessed the accuracy of the determination of trace elements in real samples of saliva and blood serum. Additionally, a possibility of determining macroelements (Ca, Mg, P, Si) in saliva is demonstrated."

The procedure involves dispersing the extractant (1-dodecanol) in the aqueous phase by rotating a cotton disk with a magnetic stirrer insert. The formation of the extractant emulsion ensures the rapid mass transfer of the target analyte. When the disk rotates in the aqueous phase, a central vortex also forms, in which a drop of the extract is formed with the subsequent destruction of the emulsion. Cooling the extraction system allows the crystallization of the extract, which is taken for an HPLC-UV analysis. The limit of detection (3σ) of 0.03 mg/L is reached. The analytical capabilities of the developed method are shown on an example of the determination of 17-β-estradiol in transdermal gels."

However, the discrimination of soils from neighboring locations can be a very challenging task. In this work, we evaluated four row-wise manipulations (RWMs) on chromatographic data of soils for improving the discriminative ability of the data. Five red, brown, and yellowish-brown soils were collected from five nearby locations in Bangi, Malaysia. Then, the non-volatile organic compounds of soils extracted via acetonitrile were determined using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. Eventually, three sets of UPLC data were obtained at 254 nm and independently pre-processed using the four RWMs, respectively. The improvements caused by the RWMs were first derived from visual inspection on the mean chromatograms and scores plot of principal component analysis. Next, the two most desired principal components were determined using a one-way ANOVA-least significant difference test and inspected via composite box plots. Results showed that standard normal variate is the only one that caused the positive impacts though not always. Normalization to sum appeared to reduce the quality of the raw data. Hence, in conclusion, the use of RWMs on the UPLC chromatogram must be carefully evaluated."

Our method screens 475 metabolites in a single run using GC-MS/MS in MRM mode, and both internal standard and quality control-based normalization strategies were used to correct the peak intensity. A total of 91 and 161 metabolites were detected in plasma and urine, respectively. The method was validated to have fine linearity range and intra-day and inter-day stability. The method was applied to a pilot study, and this study investigated the metabolic perturbation in rats after fluorochloridone (FLC) administration. 18 metabolites exhibited statistical significance in rat urine, and they were confirmed to be associated with FLC treatment, where the upregulation of glucose, lactose, and galactose is potentially linked to oxidative stress reaction. This study has proved its value in large-scale detection of metabolites in biosamples using GC-MS/MS with high sensitivity, specificity, and stability.

A fast and economically affordable method was developed for the monitoring of body state characteristics using the profile of volatile urine compounds obtained with an electronic nose based on piezosensors. Two versions, a color scale and a table, were proposed for presenting the electronic nose data; they can be used even by specially untrained personnel for the rapid and easy assessment of the most important urine analysis data (protein, glucose, mucus, and bacteria).

Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the preparation conditions and characterize the permeability of the complex for low-molecular-weight redox indicators differing in the mechanism of interaction with DNA (methylene blue and methylene green). The formation of the polyelectrolyte complex was independently confirmed by surface plasmon resonance measurements. The redox peak currents of methylene blue and methylene green varied differently depending on the number of layers of the complex and the nature of the outer layer due to different mechanisms of binding the indicators to DNA molecules and varied assembly density of the complex polyelectrolytes. An increase in the concentration of polyions from 0.1 to 10 μg/mL suppressed the effect of the charge of the outer layer on the indicator currents. Polyelectrolyte coatings were tested to detect specific DNA interactions including intercalation with the anticancer drug doxorubicin and the thermal and chemical denaturation of DNA. It was found that the introduction of decacarboxylated pillar[5]arene into the layer increased the sensitivity of the methylene blue signal to the thermal denaturation of DNA. A comparison between changes in the peak currents of methylene blue and methylene green makes it possible to distinguish the mechanism of DNA damage and separately take into account the contribution of the considered chemical and physical damaging factors. The developed DNA sensor makes it possible to semiquantitatively evaluate the protective effect of antioxidants, which decrease the effect of reactive oxygen species on DNA in the biosensor."

Using a Piezosensor-Based “Electronic Nose” for Establishing the Adulteration of Gasoline with Different Octane Numbers,"February 2022, issue 2",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193482202006X,ARTICLES,05 March 2022,"We substantiate an approach to the creation of a device for establishing gross adulteration of gasoline by replacing their part with fuel with a lower octane number and demonstrate the application of mass-sensitive sensor electrodes using the specific features of the adsorption of volatile compounds from the headspace of gasoline with different octane numbers (AI-92, AI-95) by the sensor modifiers. The results helped select three coatings most sensitive and selective to traces, differently adsorbing compounds of the highly volatile gasoline fraction. Simple recorded and calculated signals of the “electronic nose” SΣ, Sτ, A(i/j), AS(τ1/τ2), giving information on the composition of a gasoline sample and assessing the change in composition on adding fuel of a different type or brand, are proposed. The algorithm for calculating and making a decision is simple and can be programmed into the microcircuit of a mobile device. Introducing an “electronic nose” gas analyzer based on piezoelectric balances into the fuel quality control system is helpful to reveal the facts of adulteration of high-octane gasoline by adding gasoline with a lower octane number and to estimate the amount of the additive. A method is developed for in situ analysis performed by experts or untrained users; it readily gives an assessment of adulteration with an additive concentration of 6 to 50 vol % with an error of no more than 12%."

This study demonstrates that AuNCs are a promising tool for clinical and fast detection of HSA."
Alternative Strategies for the Calibration and Elimination of Matrix Effects in LC-MS/MS Multiresidue Analysis of Tea Matrix,"February 2022, issue 2",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822020034,ARTICLES,05 March 2022,"Efficiency of four different calibration techniques was evaluated on 50 pesticides in tea matrix by LC-MS/MS. Further statistical testing by MANOVA, T-tests as well as PCA indicates that calibration techniques have a significant effect on the efficiency of the analytical method to counteract the matrix effects and provide the best accuracy in the quantification. Matrix effects exceeding 20% for most of the pesticides in each calibration technique clearly indicate that matrix effects should be addressed in the calibration technique. Along with the recovery assessment, descriptive and inferential statistics proved that the procedural standard calibration technique (mean recovery of 89.3%, SD of 9.14, and standard error mean of 1.29) was the better approach than the matrix matched calibration technique. The matrix matched calibration with an internal standard, without any internal standard, and use of internal standard for some selected compounds, i.e., mix mode internal standard, were also studied."

The constants of protolysis of the functional groups of triarylmethane dyes are determined by spectrophotometry. The dependence of the recovery of dyes on alumina on the pH of the solution is found. It is shown that the recovery of triarylmethane dyes is maximum at pH 4 and depends on the presence of ionized sulfo groups and the number of condensed benzene rings in the molecule.

An increased usage of phenol has caused an increase in its content in water sources and at the same time brings negative effect to the environment. This paper reported an approach consisting of dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) combined with UV-Vis spectrophotometric detection at 280 nm in order to extract phenol in water samples. Some difficulties were reported in the formation of a double layer for separation between the dispersive and extraction solvent which is important to ensure the successful DLLME application and the high percent recovery of the extracted phenol. Therefore, our research interest focused on the effect of dispersive and extraction solvents by using different solvent characteristics for phenol extraction from real water. The optimum conditions, i.e., extraction solvent (1-dodecanol) volume of 2 mL and dispersive solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) volume of 2.5 mL, were determined using response surface methodology. DLLME-UV-Vis is a suitable method for phenol extraction because it is simple, fast, low cost and produces high percentage recovery of phenol."

Spectrometric Determination of the Total Concentration of Single-Type Analytes Using Conventional Multidimensional Calibrations,"January 2022, issue 1",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/77-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934822010142,ARTICLES,11 February 2022,"Multidimensional calibrations can be used for the spectrometric determination of the total concentration (cΣ) of similar substances; these calibrations relate the generalized signals (AΣ)j measured at different wavelengths (λj) with the concentrations of these analytes (ci) and their absorption coefficients (kij). Such calibrations are conventionally used for the separate determination of analytes, while the ci values are calculated using chemometric algorithms. To find cΣ, one should only take a sum of the found ci values. Despite the simplicity of this type of group analysis, it is rarely used, and its capabilities have not been studied. It is unclear how the accuracy of the cΣ estimate depends on the number of analytical wavelengths (AWLs), the number of standards, and other factors. The purpose of this study was to obtain relevant information using an example of model mixtures of arenes. The absorption spectra of arene mixtures were recorded in the region 230–280 nm, where these spectra are additive. We analyzed 55 hexane solutions containing three to six arenes with a total concentration of 0.1–0.5 mg/mL. The qualitative composition of the model mixtures was considered to compose the matrix of absorption coefficients of individual arenes. The ci values were found by multiple linear regression (MLR, direct calibration). With a sufficiently large number of AWLs, the found ci values were close to zero for arenes absent in the sample and close to the actual ci values for the present arenes. The summation of the found ci gave approximately correct estimates of cΣ (±5%). The single errors of the group analysis were, as a rule, smaller than the errors of the determination of the mixture components. The complication of the model (the introduction of “extra” standards and an increase in the number of AWLs) did not affect the accuracy of the results of group analysis, and the simplification of the model increased errors. If only the most typical standards were used to form the model, the values of kij of which covered the entire range of possible values of kij, the presence of components in the sample that were not taken into account by the simplified model did not lead to a noticeable increase in errors."

Lactic (2-hydroxypropanoic) acid is the main component of the fingerprint that can possess this effect. The presence of lactic acid or a fingerprint in the sample does not significantly affect the efficiency of tetryl detection; although it changes the qualitative composition of pentaerythritol tetranitrate and RDX ions, causing the appearance of intense peaks in the spectrum, presumably, adducts of ions of these substances with lactic acid molecules, and dramatically impairs the efficiency of the formation of ions of other explosives.

However, sometimes AM can cause a variety of side effects similar to those caused by biogenic amines (BAs). So far, there has been no information about the type and content of BAs in AMs. Thus, an HPLC method with precolumn derivatization was developed for the characterization of ten kinds of BAs in seven commonly used AMs to provide referential data for the safety profile of AMs. The described method has good repeatability and reproducibility for the quantification of BAs in seven kinds of AMs. Among the ten selected BAs, histamine in Scolopendra was found to be 96 ± 4 mg/kg, exceeding the limit regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Although the levels of BAs in Scorpio, Hirudo, Bombyx Batryticatus, Gecko, Pheretima, and Eupolyphaga Steleophaga are below the amine toxicity level currently regulated and are safe to use individually, AMs are often used in combination with other TCMs containing BAs. This would lead to the overdose of toxic BAs. Therefore, it is necessary to propose limit standards for BAs in AMs and their polypharmacy to ensure their safety profiles and improve the quality standards."

This method was applied to estimate picrosides, phenolics and cucurbitacins in leaves and rhizomes. The separation of molecules was achieved at 260 nm in 20 min on a C-18 BEH column (2.1 × 100 mm, particle size of 1.7 µm) with gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Linearity (r2) of standards was found to be 0.999, limits of detection and quantification were between 0.06–1.4 and 0.19–4 µg/mL, respectively. The recoveries of molecules were in the range of 86.6–102.7%. The method was found to be reproducible, uniform and specific. The contents of identified analytes in rhizomes were the highest in ethanol, followed by methanol and water extracts, whereas water extract of leaves contained the highest content of analytes followed by ethanol and methanol.

The equilibria in the membrane–solution system were studied depending on the acidity of the medium and the amount of the ionophore in order to reveal the mechanism of membrane functioning. At pH 1–2, octadecylamine is in the cationic form, and cadmium ions in a 0.1 M KI solution are in the form of [CdI3]–.

Furthermore, a new modified graphite screen printed electrode is introduced using the synthesized BNNS-NiCo2O4. The efficiency of BNNS-NiCo2O4 as a sensor modifier for the electrocatalytic oxidation of mangiferin in aqueous solutions was examined via chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The outcomes demonstrated that the application of the developed electrode (BNNS-NiCo2O4/screen printed electrode (SPE)) in electrooxidation of mangiferin (pH 7.0) results in high anodic peak currents. Mangiferin oxidation peak potential at the BNNS-NiCo2O4/SPE surface was determined at 310 mV, which was approximately 120 mV less compared to the oxidation potential at the SPE surface under identical circumstances. In addition, the peak current was approximately two times higher at the BNNS-NiCo2O4/SPE surface in comparison to that of the SPE. The associated linear response range and detection limit were determined as 0.01–800 and 0.04 μM, respectively.

The corrected retention volume does not obey gas laws; because of this, numerous relationships obtained in gas chromatography without taking into account this property of the corrected retention volume should be revised. We considered publications of various authors in order to illustrate inconsistencies and contradictions that follow from the nonrecognition (or rejection) of this fact."

It was found that the main pathways leading to the formation of positively charged ions are the following: protonation; addition of ammonium, synthesized in the ion source; and photoionization. In the negative ionization mode, deprotonated molecules, anion adduct ions, and molecular ions are formed. In both modes, ions formed as a result of the preliminary oxidation of analyte molecules in the ion source and their subsequent ionization were detected. A possibility of using the APLPI for the rapid analysis of pharmaceutical drugs without sample preparation is demonstrated."

Study of Lignin by Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry: Effect of Spectral Resolution,"December 2021, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821140082,ARTICLES,22 December 2021,"Atmospheric pressure photoionization Orbitrap mass spectrometry is a promising tool for studying lignin. It ensures the detection of thousands of lignin oligomers with molecular weights of up to 1.5–2 kDa and the reliable determination of their elemental compositions. In the present work, the effects of the resolving power of the mass analyzer on the recorded mass spectra of lignins and the results of characterization of the molecular composition of the biopolymer were studied. The test sample was a native dioxane lignin preparation, isolated from cedar wood. The phenomenon of the suppression of signals of lignin oligomers in the region of high molecular weights with an increase in the resolving power of the mass analyzer because of decay processes in the ion trap is described. It has been shown that a spectral resolution of at least 70 000 (M/ΔM, at m/z = 200) is required for screening purposes and the determination of the elemental compositions of low-molecular-weight lignin fractions. A detailed study of the molecular composition of lignin requires the use of spectral resolution of 280 000; it ensures a multiple increase in the number of detectable oligomers in the range of molecular weights above 1 kDa and also the reliable identification of signals of lignin–carbohydrate complexes."
Ion-Molecular Reactions of Esters of Carbocyclic Alcohols in a Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) Mass Spectrometer,"December 2021, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821140057,ARTICLES,22 December 2021,"We studied the interaction of acyl derivatives of carbocyclic alcohols of steroid structure with nitrogenous bases in the ion source of a “direct analysis in real time” (DART) mass spectrometer. The protonation of esters in the DART plasma is accompanied by the elimination of a corresponding acid (acyl derivatives of cholesterol, β-sitosterol, and estradiol), interaction of the formed cation with a nitrogenous base to yield a derivative with a bound charge. This effect was not observed for cortisone acetate and betamethasone dipropionate, which is consistent with the absence of ions of deacyl derivatives in their DART mass spectra."
Supercritical Fluid Chromatography–Mass-Spectrometry of Nitrogen-Containing Compounds: Atmospheric Pressure Ionization,"December 2021, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821140070,ARTICLES,22 December 2021,"Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) in combination with mass spectrometry is a promising alternative to traditional chromatographic methods for the separation of polar nitrogen-containing compounds. The specificity of carbon dioxide-based mobile phases, used in this method, can affect the processes of the mass-spectrometric ionization of analytes and, as a consequence, the optimization strategy of the SFC–MS method. In this study, the effects of the composition of the CO2–methanol mobile phase, its flow rate, and also the parameters of the ion source (ESI capillary and corona discharge needle voltages, temperature) on the efficiency of ESI and APCI for a wide range of nitrogen-containing compounds from different classes were investigated. It was found that, because of the high basicity of the analytes under study, ESI in the positive ion mode is the preferred method of ionization, providing a multiple gain in efficiency compared to APCI for most analytes. An increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the mobile phase leads to a significant increase in the ESI efficiency and has a multidirectional effect on the ionization of analytes with different proton affinities under APCI conditions. An increase in APCI temperature leads to a decrease in the intensity of signals of protonated molecules and to the occurring of fragmentation processes regardless of the composition of the mobile phase for the vast majority of analytes."

Relevant compounds are searched by molecule-containing ion masses (only ChemSpider) or by molecular formulas before determined (both databases). The compounds that are highly cited and information-rich are candidates for identification. PubChem contains more direct information on the properties and use of chemical compounds than that in the other database. These data give evidence of the likelihood of identification. Final decisions on identification are made with the traditional use of reference analytical data (mass spectra and chromatography retention parameters) and analytical reference materials.
The Effect of Pseudorandom Sequence Systematicity on Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Hadamard Transform Ion Mobility Spectrometry,"December 2021, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193482113013X,ARTICLES,14 December 2021,"The formation of an artefact signal can greatly influence the sensitivity of the drift tube ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) in multiplex mode (Hadamard transform mode). This signal is a systematic error of multiplexed signal modulation via pseudorandom sequence (PRS), and it can appear as false peaks, or it can be similar to interference or noise. The artefact signal usually cannot be differentiated from the latter by standard mathematical processing algorithms. In Hadamard transform ion mobility spectrometry, the presence of an artefact signal when utilizing standard data processing algorithms results in the following situation. Even though each individual recovered spectrum demonstrates a noticeable improvement in signal-to-noise ratio due to forward Hadamard transform, this improvement is reduced or even disappears completely for averaged recovered multiplexed spectra when compared to the conventional IMS averaging mode. A noticeable improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved by modifying PRSs by incorporating fixed numbers of additional zeros after every element (modulation bin) of the conventional PRSs. The improvement can be explained because the addition suppresses systematic noise-like artefact signals. In this paper, we analyze the observed signal-to-noise ratio in averaged spectra for simulated via theoretical model and experimental data for various multiplexing modes of Hadamard transform. We also analyzed the influence of modulating PRSs’ “randomness” on signal-to-noise ratio in the resulting spectra in the case of non-modified sequences. We chose the standard deviation of PRS’s autocorrelation function, or the autocorrelation coefficient, to serve as the “randomness” criterion. For modulation with PRSs modified with additional zeros, we observed a considerable correlation between theoretical and experimental values of relative improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. This indirectly proves the existence of constraints in Hadamard multiplexing mode when a statistically significant amount of individual spectra is averaged. This also leads to the necessity of improved strategies of data multiplexing and decoding for further sensitivity improvement. The choice of optimal PRS is part of the strategy’s search. One of the choice’s criterion is the minimization of the artefact signal. The data presented in this paper suggests that the autocorrelation coefficient as the criterion of choice for PRS is justified but not sufficient: it leaves the problem of PRS selection when searching for a strategy for sensitivity improvement in Hadamard transform ion mobility spectrometry."

The limit of detection for morphine mixed with blood by the method was tens of picograms with a linear range of more than two orders of magnitude. It was shown that because of the high selectivity of the method, such a complex sample can be analyzed without its preliminary chromatographic separation and extraction, which will significantly reduce the time of analysis of the sample, and also, because of the high sensitivity of the method, reduce false negative results."

In this work, we computed the structure and determined the conformational composition of DTBP and products of its protonation using quantum chemical methods. We found three conformers of DTBP with similar stabilities. We showed that their protonation leads to three products with similar stabilities. The proton affinity and ga--s-phase basicity of DTBP were calculated. The thermodynamic parameters of DTBP reactions with hydrated hydroxonium ions H3O+(H2O)n (n = 0–3) were computed. The calculations confirmed that, in agreement with the experimental data, the reactions lead to the formation of protonated DTBP molecules that are not hydrated and do not form proton-bound dimers. We showed that the peculiarities of DTBP protonation are substantially due to the steric effect of tert-butyl groups. The reduced mobility of protonated DTBP molecules was calculated by the trajectory method. The calculation error is close to the experimental one. According to the experimental data, the calculated reduced mobilities do not significantly change with temperature."

It was demonstrated that the observed discrepancy between the predicted and experimental data can be explained by the memory effect rather than by the heterogeneous evaporation effect. The similarities between these effects, occurring in thermal ionization ion sources, were discussed as well. It was shown that the replacement of a single-filament ion source with a double-filament source ensures a decrease in the memory effect and the improvement of the precision of the 88Sr/86Sr measurement by a factor of more than two: from ±0.037‰ to ±0.013‰.

The “robust” settings of the mass spectrometer are given suitable to determine Fe, Ni, Cr, Co, Cu, V, Mn, and rare-earth metals in cerium oxide (nebulizer gas flow, liquid flow, plasma sampling depth, the extract lens voltage), lowering the matrix effect and, therefore, enabling the use of more concentrated solutions for analysis.

The combination of mass spectral and atomic emission methods has some advantages, expands the range of elements to be determined, and increases the reliability of the analysis. In particular, the use of ICP–OES makes it possible to determine low concentrations of terbium in cerium oxide (the limit of determination for terbium by ICP–OES is 1 × 10–4 wt %) and decreases the limits of determination for Fe and Pr by a factor of 4–5 compared to ICP–MS.

It is found that the most promising sensor for determining tryptophan enantiomers is the sensor modified by copper(II) (bis)L-phenylalaninate. In determining tryptophan enantiomers, this sensor provides a linear concentration range from 6.25 × 10–7 to 0.5 × 10–3 M for L-tryptophan and from 5 × 10–6 to 0.5 × 10–3 M for D-tryptophan. The sensor is more sensitive to L-tryptophan. The proposed sensor was used for the recognition and determination of tryptophan enantiomers in human urine and plasma samples, and also in a mixture of enantiomers. The statistical assessment of the results of determinations by the spiked–found method indicates the absence of a significant systematic error."

From the cyclic voltammetry, it was confirmed that the addition of As(V) reduces the diffusion coefficient of the ARS molecule towards the electrode surface. The experimental results revealed that the diffusion coefficient of ARS was 1.476 × 10−5 cm2/s which decreased to 1.02 × 10−5 cm2/s in the presence of \({\text{AsO}}_{4}^{{3 - }}\) ions in the solution. Measurements of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were also carried out, and an upward pattern of charge transfer resistance (Rct) was found with an increase in As(V) concentration. The EIS technique gave a linear relationship in terms of Rct vs. As(V) concentration. Hence, it was concluded that this technique could be utilized in the electrochemical detection of As(V). The developed method for the detection of As(V) has exhibited excellent sensitivity (74 Ω/µM), low detection limit (14.2 ± 0.1 ppb at S/N of 3), and remarkable repeatability."

Characteristic heat effects were determined for a series of oil samples, namely, temperatures of the maxima of endothermic peaks on DSC thermograms in five ranges: Т1 from –37.6 to –31.1°C, Т2 from –27.6 to –23.8°C, Т3 from –19.9 to –14.4°C, Т4 from –13.5 to –4.2°C, and Т5 from –4.7 to –1.2°C and the areas of these peaks. The maximum at T1 was attributed to the fraction of triunsaturated triacylglycerols (UUU; U means unsaturated), which have the lowest Tmp. The most pronounced maxima at T2 and T3 were formed by a mixture of triunsaturated (UUU) and diunsaturated, monosaturated triacylglycerol (UUS, S means saturated) fractions. The maxima at T4 and T5 were formed upon the melting of fractions of monounsaturated and trisaturated triacylglycerols (USS and SSS). Phenotypic factors, that is, a set of conditions for the growth of raw materials (altitude, humus content in the soil, amount of precipitation, and a number of sunny days throughout the year) affect the positions of the maxima of endothermic peaks and their areas. It was demonstrated that DSC can help to control the authenticity of milk thistle oil and its origin."

The observed red shift and color change were attributed to the strong electrostatic attraction between the glycoaminoglycans and heparin binding groups present in cTnI. The method exhibits linearity between cTnI concentration and corresponding absorbance in the range of 0.5–20 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.3 ng/mL. Other major blood proteins did not show any interference, and the binding was found to be pH dependent.

The technique is based on the principle that spiro conjugation present in 1',3'-dihydrospiro-N,N-ketal[indene-2,2'-pyrimidine]-1,3-dione (spiro-N,N-ketal) is disturbed after HCl addition. As a result of disturbance in spiro conjugation, a change in the absorbance at its peak maxima (426 nm) is observed with respect to the corresponding change in HCl concentration. Spiro-N,N-ketal was prepared by condensation of ninhydrin and naphthalene-1,8-diamine and characterized by UV-Vis, FTIR and NMR techniques. Reaction of spiro-N,N-ketal with HCl in both aqueous and organic mediums (without any catalyst) was followed by spectrophotometric detection. This reaction involves a distinct color change from yellow to colorless. Variables such as temperature and concentration were optimized to quantify HCl in both mediums in the concentration range of 4 mM–0.2 M. Initial rate and fixed time methods were adopted for kinetic study. The order of the reaction was found to be two. Minimum detectable limit for HCl in both mediums was found to be 0.2 mM. Repeatability tests were performed at different concentrations of HCl in both mediums to confirm the same reactivity at particular concentrations. Trials were done by three different analysts to see the analyst bias. Relative standard deviation (RSD) for five replicate determinations by each analyst was found to be less than 1.5%. The proposed technique was applied for HCl quantification in tap water to evaluate interferences. Vapors emanated from propellant slab burning were trapped in water and methanol under chilling conditions. Solutions thus obtained were diluted to the working concentration range. RSD for five replicate determinations of these solutions using spiro-N,N-ketal was found to be less than 1.7% (aqueous) and 1.9% (organic), which confirms the reliability of the proposed technique. Spiro-N,N-ketal was found to be a superior chemisorbent in chemisorption tubes which can be used for trapping HCl vapors in launch pad/static testing areas and HCl quantification in air as well as in water."

An analysis of the thermodynamic functions of adsorption showed that the differences in molar changes in the internal energy and entropy of the adsorption of enantiomers of haloalkanes are due to the predominant adsorption of one of enantiomers inside a cavity of the supramolecular structure of guanine, and of the other, on its surface. It was found that the proposed stationary phase possesses enantioselectivity with respect to haloalkanes. Racemates of 2-bromoheptane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,2-dibromopropane, and 2-chlorobutane were separated by gas chromatography.

The assessment of the binding of REEs to various organomineral phases of soils remains an important task. Using soddy-podzolic soil and typical chernozem as examples, we performed a comparative study of two procedures of the fractionation of REEs in soils in the dynamic extraction mode. According to a five-stage procedure using a 0.05 M Ca(NO3)2 solution, 0.43 M CH3COOH, a 0.1 M NH2OH⋅HCl solution (pH 3.6), a 0.1 M K4P2O7 solution (pH 11.0), and a 0.1 M (NH4)2C2O4 solution (pH 3.2), five extractable fractions were isolated, which can be conventionally named, exchangeable, specifically sorbed, associated with manganese oxides, associated with organic matter, and associated with amorphous and weakly crystallized oxides of iron and aluminum, respectively. A four-stage procedure, using a 0.05 M Ca(NO3)2 solution, a 0.1 M citric acid solution, a 0.05 M NH2OH⋅HCl solution (pH 2.0), and 1.4 M HNO3, enabled the isolation of exchange ions and fractions bound to carbonates, reducible, and acid-soluble, respectively. The concentration of elements in the initial samples and extracts was determined by atomic emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In a five-stage procedure, the main extractable REE species (up to 40% of the total content) is provided by organometallic complexes extracted with a 0.1 M solution of potassium pyrophosphate. Using a four-stage procedure, the main fraction of REEs (up to 30%) is extracted with 1.4 M nitric acid. Using La, Ce, and Nd as examples, two procedures were compared. The concentration of REEs extracted by nitric acid (four-stage procedure) corresponds to the concentration of REEs extracted by pyrophosphate (five-stage procedure). In addition, the use of a 0.05 M NH2OH⋅HCl solution at pH 2.0 (four-stage procedure) and a 0.1 M (NH4)2C2O4 solution at pH 3.2 (five-stage procedure) leads to similar results. Thus, both procedures can be used for the dynamic fractionation of REE species in soils. However, the five-stage procedure is preferable, because the reagents used are sufficiently selective with respect to the dissolved organomineral phases of soils, which more clearly reflects the pattern of the distribution of REE species."

Scopes of Bioanalytical Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry,"October 2021, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193482108013X,REVIEWS,24 September 2021,"The areas of application of modern bioanalytical chromatography–mass spectrometry are so extensive that any attempt to systematize them becomes subjective. It would be more correct to say that there is no such area of biology and medicine where chromatography–mass spectrometry would not find application. This article focuses on the areas of application of this technique that are either relatively new or insufficiently covered in recent reviews. State-of-the-art bioanalytical techniques have become multitargeted in terms of analytes and standardized in terms of matrices. The ability to detect trace concentrations of analytes in the presence of a huge number of biomatrix macrocomponents using chromatography–mass spectrometry is especially important for bioanalytical chemistry. In the target-oriented determination of persistent organic pollutants by chromatography–mass spectrometry, the main problem is the expansion of the list of analytes, including isomers. In the detection of exposures to unstable toxicants, the fragmented adducts of xenobiotics with biomolecules become target biomarkers along with hydrolytic metabolites. The exposome reflects the general exposure of a human being to total xenobiotics and the metabolic status reflects the physiological state of the body. Chromatography–mass spectrometry is a key technique in metabolomics. Metabolomics is currently used to solve the problems of clinical diagnostics and anti-doping control. Biological sample preparation procedures for instrumental analysis are being simplified and developed toward increasing versatility. Proteomic technologies with the use of various versions of mass spectrometry have found application in the development of new methods for diagnosing coronavirus infections."

Currently, there are no reference samples of natural nanoparticles, which complicates the study of the role of nanoparticles in specific processes, including geochemical ones, and makes it almost impossible to compare the results obtained by different researchers. In this work, nanoparticles of kaolinite, montmorillonite, and muscovite are studied as potential reference samples of natural nanoparticles. A complex of analytical methods has been proposed for the isolation and characterization of mineral nanoparticles, including the field flow fractionation of particles in a rotating coiled column, laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. According to laser diffraction data, 93–98% of the isolated particles are from 40 to 300 nm in size; 2–7% of particles have sizes of up to 830 nm. The sizes of the isolated particles were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Based on the aluminum content, the concentrations of mineral nanoparticles in the isolated suspensions were estimated. The aggregation stability of nanoparticles in 5 mM phosphate buffer solutions of pH 6, 7, and 8 was studied. Muscovite nanoparticles are stable at pH 7 and 8 for at least 4 weeks, while montmorillonite nanoparticles have similar stability only at pH 8.

Hydroquinone, uric acid and boric acid act as carbon, nitrogen and boron sources for BNCNDs synthesis, respectively. Interestingly, the green emission of BNCNDs is quenched in the presence of Cu2+ by electron transfer. Upon addition of the specific reagent (PLA), Cu2+ ion is removed from the surface of BNCNDs owing to the formation of a strong complex between PLA and Cu2+ ion, which leads to a significant fluorescence recovery of BNCNDs. The “turn-on” phenomenon allows to determine PLA by a very simple method. This chemosensing method displays a linear range from 50 nM to 80 μM with a detection limit of 14 nM (3σ/k) for PLA. The method was applied to the determination of PLA in fetal bovine serum samples with the recoveries between 94 and 106%, which shows that this method has potential for use in applications to real samples."

It is found that in replacing acetonitrile for methanol, it is necessary to use two components of the mobile phase, containing only methanol and only formic acid, as on the joint presence of these substances, a prolonged retention drift is observed, presumably because of the acylation of methanol. It is found that the replacement of acetonitrile for methanol results in small changes in the selectivity of the separation of anthocyanins with identical substituents but different aglycones and with different carbohydrate substituents for one and the same aglycone. There are also no significant differences in the separation efficiency (by the number of theoretical plates) of anthocyanins, which makes it possible to reject expensive acetonitrile in favor of methanol. The developed procedure was applied to determine anthocyanins in cranberry fruits of various degrees of ripeness (by color). The specific features of the anthocyanin composition of cranberry fruits are determined and the need in controlling the composition of the sample solvent for excluding artifact peaks is shown."

To optimize extraction methods for PCBs in microplastics, a 24-1 fractional factorial design was applied. Four factors were optimized, namely, sample amount, number of extraction cycles, solvent volume and extraction time. For PET analysis, sample amount was statistically significant for 5 congeners (PCBs 105, 118, 153, 138 and 180), number of extraction cycles and solvent volume were statistically significant only for PCB 101 and extraction time was statistically significant for PCBs 153 and 101. In the case of u-PVC, statistical analysis revealed no relevant variables. For LDPE, sample amount and solvent volume were statistically significant for the lower chlorinated compounds and sample amount was also statistically significant for PCB 52. PCB extracts were analyzed by GC-MS/MS system (triple quadrupole). The separation step of microplastics from marine samples was also tested. For this purpose, studies of behavior of PCBs during the digestion of organic matter were also performed by using KOH and H2O2 solutions. The best results were achieved when 30% H2O2 solution was used. The analytical performance of extraction method demonstrated a broad linear concentration range (R2 < 0.998), in general recoveries around 80–100% and relative standard deviation below 15%.

Besides, urease (Urs) was physically immobilized over the In2O5Sn/SnO2:F matrix surface for fast and simple trace urea quantification with a novel mechanism. Initially, the qualities of constructed In2O5Sn nanoparticles were considered by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The nanoparticles reveal exceptional effects in the Urs redox reaction on Urs/In2O5Sn/SnO2:F biosensor. Therefore, urea concentration was obtained directly by electrochemical techniques with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity. The fabricated biosensor affords a unique response over a wide concentration range of 5–175 mg/dL for urea with the low detection limit (3 mg/dL), fast response time (less than 3 s) and relatively long life span (40 days). Stability with verification of the suitability of the modified Urs/In2O5Sn/SnO2:F biosensor in the analysis of blood serum was assessed. The results obtained were in agreement with those attained from the independent standard method."

Electrodeposition of precipitate components on the GE surface was carried out in “in situ” mode. There was made an assumption about the composition of phase structures on the surface of the GE. Heat of mixing of components of binary alloy of lead-platinum is calculated by using the thermodynamic theory of alloys. The displacement of the equilibrium potential of lead during selective electrooxidation of it from the binary electrolytic precipitate of lead-platinum was estimated in the approximation of the theory of regular solutions. It has been shown that the equilibrium potential of lead in a platinum alloy depends on the composition of the intermetallic compound (IC).

The degree of preference between the wine samples is expressed in terms of the similarity of sensory estimates, evaluated by the geometric distance between them. In addition to ranking wines, this approach allowed us to study their cluster structure and reveal three groups of homogeneous wines based on the results of a set of expert scores given to them. A correlation the cluster structure of wines with their places in the ranked list is found. The consistency of wine ratings based on the proposed chemometric approach, arithmetic mean, and median scores is demonstrated. From the point of view of multivariate analysis, rating wines by the geometric distance is mathematically more reasonable, because it is built in accordance with the Euclidean metric, and the sum of coordinates of points, the calculation of the arithmetic mean is based on, does not correspond to any of the known metrics. Another advantage of the geometric approach is that the use of the arithmetic mean for the final assessment of the tasting results is justified at a great number of experts."

For red wines, the contributions of metals and volatile compounds to the variability of sensory estimates are approximately equal, and in the case of white wines, the contribution of volatile compounds is much higher than the contribution of metals. The constructed models can be used to predict sensory estimates of red and white wines based on the concentrations of volatile compounds and metals."

The sample decomposition process involved the passage of very dilute solutions of HClO4 and H2O2 as a reagent mixture in dynamic mode through a PTFE coil wound over a UV lamp for irradiation followed by the quantification of fluoride by spectrophotometry based on bleaching of Zr−xylenol orange complex by fluoride. The optimization involved the study of the following critical parameters affecting the UV-photolytic decomposition (UVPD): concentration of the extractant mixture (HClO4 and H2O2), sample flow rate and length of the PTFE reaction coil to get a quantitative recovery of fluoride. The methodology was optimized by using three bulk drugs, namely, afatinib, dolutegravir and fluphenazine, chosen as representatives of three diverse compounds. Using the experimental conditions established during optimization, the developed method (5 mL of mixture of 0.4% (v/v) HClO4 and 0.2% (v/v) H2O2, a sample flow rate of 2.5 mL/min and a 1.5 m coil length), it was possible to completely converse the covalently bound fluorine to free fluoride ion for its subsequent determination by spectrophotometry. Quantitative recovery (>98%) of fluorine in all the test samples with a detection limit of 0.18 µg/g was achieved. Accuracy was evaluated by comparison of results obtained by the present UVPD method with the values of formula weights of the compounds. No statistical difference was observed between the results based on the paired t-test at a 95% confidence level. The optimized UVPD approach was subsequently applied to various pharmaceutical drugs and oral hygienic products (toothpaste and mouthwash) of a few leading brands purchased from the local market."
UV-Spectrometric Determination of Total Concentration of Arenes in Wastewaters,"July 2021, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821070042,ARTICLES,03 July 2021,"Two methods are proposed for assessing the total concentration (cAr) of the most toxic hydrocarbons (arenes) in wastewaters. The procedures include the extraction of petroleum products with n-hexane, the adsorption purification of the extract from phenols, and the measurement of the absorbance of arenes in the UV region. No separation of alkanes and cycloalkanes is required. The first method enables the rapid estimation of cAr in terms of the standard substance Xst (o-xylene or m-xylene) for screening purposes. Absorbance is measured at 250 nm, which decreases the effect of intragroup selectivity and phenols remaining in the extract. The total concentrations of arenes in n-hexane solutions are estimated by this method rather accurately (error δc < 7% at RSD < 5%). However, the analysis of aqueous solutions (wastewater simulant solutions) in the range of cAr from 0.1 to 50 mg/L leads to δc > 50%. The results of cAr estimation in simulations and wastewaters are underestimated, which is mainly due to the loss of arenes during sample preparation. Using the second (more accurate) method, the absorbance of the extract is measured at seven wavelengths in the region 240–280 nm. The cAr value is found by multiple linear regression without recalculation to Xst. Multivariate calibrations are constructed using extracts from 25 simulated solutions (training set) and passing them through all sample preparation operations, which decreases the loss of analytes. At cAr > 1 mg/L, the error in the analysis of simulants from the test set does not exceed 20% at RSD < 12%. The duration of analysis is 1 h. The procedure was tested in the analysis of wastewaters from enterprises of various profiles. The results agree with the results of chromatographic analyses of the same samples."

In this study, various lipstick samples were analyzed using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). ATR-FTIR method was useful for preliminary categorization of lipstick. Generally, ToF-SIMS provides chemical information about sample surfaces. Each lipstick sample showed characteristic ion peaks in the ToF-SIMS spectra. To investigate the effect of the substrate on the ToF-SIMS spectra, two lipsticks were applied to five different substrates (white paper, glass slide, tissue paper, orange cotton fabric, and black cotton fabric) and analyzed using principal component analysis. Trace lipstick smears deposited on tissue paper and cigarette butts were analyzed and compared with results from reference lipstick samples. ToF-SIMS is a promising technique for discrimination and classification of lipsticks in forensic science."

It ensures a rapid assessment of standard indicators, that is, the acid number of lauric substitute for cocoa butter by the signal of the sensor with polyethylene glycol adipate (Pearson’s correlation degree R = 0.94), the acidity of confectionery masses of different nature by the signals of sensors based on crown ether and Tween-40 (R = 0.90–0.92). The most valuable achievement is the ability of controlling the decrease in the concentration of nonvolatile compounds and the total concentration of sugars and reducing sugars during conching, based on the signals from two sensors (R = 0.90–0.93). We also show a possibility of introducing an electronic nose gas analyzer based on adsorption-type sensors into the control system of confectionery production for determining physical and chemical parameters and digitizing the most unstable property, that is, aroma, compliance and optimization of recipes, an objective and reproducible assessment of the quality of raw materials and confectionery products, and the control of the reproducibility of the integral indicator (aroma) for different batches of finished products."

A combination of chromatographic methods with FTIR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, or other methods is used. In solving complex analytical problems of industrial nature, it is economically expedient to use only chromatographic methods. In analyzing complex multicomponent mixtures with a high density of peaks in the chromatogram, the precision of the determination of retention time determines the reliability of the identification of substances and of the result of analysis, using identification both directly by the absolute retention time and by relative parameters derived from it (relative retention times, retention indices). The standard deviation of a measurement of the chromatographic retention time is a measure of precision. Experimental chromatographic retention times were obtained for analyzing a mixture by the following scheme: initial isotherm, temperature programming, final isotherm. A sharp increase (by one order of magnitude) in the numerical value of the standard deviation was noted at the step of temperature programming. A regression equation was obtained linking the point estimate of the standard deviation of the retention time and column temperature. The performance characteristic of the regression equation is obtained as a function that enables calculating the total standard uncertainty in the estimate of the standard deviation of the chromatographic retention time. The results can be used to refine chromatographic retention time and indices that ensure the reliable identification of substances."

In the present study, a novel AuNPs based aptasensor strategy for the detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) was used. For this purpose, two different batches of AuNPs were functionalized by thiol modified DNA probes (P1 and P2) complementary to 5' and 3' ends of anti-TNT aptamer. Then, two batches of gold nanoprobes were mixed and the addition of anti-TNT aptamer induced the assembly and aggregation of nanoparticles. However, according to this strategy, in the presence of TNT, aptamer can bind to its target molecule (TNT) and prevent nanoparticles aggregation. The results indicate that the produced aptasensor can detect TNT molecule with high specificity (detection limit of 6 pM). In conclusion, this gold nanoparticle-based colorimetric anti-TNT aptasensor can be used in the next investigations with high efficiency."

The reasons for the insufficiently detailed characterization of numerous well-known hydrates of organic compounds are analyzed, the main of which is their instability. The CAS numbers assigned to many of these hydrates confirm interest in these hydrates. We found that the reversible formation of the hydrates of various organic compounds can be a reason for anomalous dependences of their retention parameters (tR) on the concentration of an organic eluent modifier (c) in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The recurrent approximation of the retention parameters tR(c + Δc) = atR(c) + b (*), where Δc = const is a constant step of c, is the most effective way to detect these anomalies. Deviations of dependences like (*) from linearity are observed with compounds in which variations in c and, consequently, in the water content of the eluent (1 – c) affect the equilibrium of the reaction \({\text{X}} + n{{{\text{H}}}_{{\text{2}}}}{\text{O }} \rightleftarrows {\text{X}} \cdot n{{{\text{H}}}_{{\text{2}}}}{\text{O}}.\)"

The high quantum yield, photostability, narrow emission spectra, and wide excitation regions of these species make them ideal labels for analysis and ensure the development of procedures for the simultaneous determination of several substances and the attainment of low limits of detection. The widespread introduction of QDs in analytical practice is limited by the multistage character and laboriousness of some approaches to the synthesis of QDs and reagents on their basis, their trend to nonspecific interactions, and a probability of fluorescence reabsorption at the improper selection of the concentration of QDs. The review covers the main approaches to the synthesis, modification, and use of luminescence QDs in chemical analysis. Approaches to the sensitization and multiplicity of analysis and methods for regulating selectivity based on both the properties of QDs and, in addition, the receptors used are discussed."

Quantitative and qualitative differences were found in the chemical compositions of the analyzed samples depending on the extraction method. Headspace (HS) was the most efficient extraction method as HS extracts were the most concentrated. This allows to reach the lowest limits of detection and quantification for the different standards extracted by HS (eugenol LOD by HS is 0.0022 µg/g against 0.03 µg/g by liquid injection). Furthermore, as HS is a simple, rapid, solventless and automated extraction method, it should be considered as an alternative technique to hydrodistillation or pressurized liquid extraction when quantifying terpenoids in food matrices."

Electrochemical deposition was performed by cyclic voltammetry in a potential range of 0.0–0.8 V at a scan rate of 25 mV/s in 10 cycles. Polymer growth and template leach conditions were systematically investigated for determining optimal settings in developing the sensor. Under optimal working conditions, the differential pulse voltammetric current response of MP oxidation was linear in the range of 10–50000 µM (R2 = 0.9682) with a detection limit of 10 µM (S/N ratio of 10). The molecularly imprinted polymer modified electrode showed an excellent selectivity and sensitivity towards MP compared to its structural analogues. The developed sensor was successfully applied to the detection of methyl paraben in four samples of pharmaceuticals and a personal care product."

However, cytotoxicity was reported at its high doses. Therefore, gatifloxacin overdose monitoring is very important. In this sense, there is a need for developing fast and cheap analytical methods for gatifloxacin quantitation in biological fluids. In the present study, a novel detection strategy involving gatifloxacin quantification in urine samples was developed. The approach has been adapted for the use of solid inner contact and rapid disposal screen-printed graphitic carbon electrodes exhibiting high sensitivity toward gatifloxacin without interference from several ions found in urine samples. The developed electrodes showed linear responses in the concentration ranges from 1 × 10–5 to 0.01 and 1 × 10–6 to 0.01 M for a solid contact glassy carbon ion selective electrode (GSC) and a screen printed electrode (GSP), respectively. The analytical applicability of the approach was demonstrated through recovery experiments of gatifloxacin trace concentrations in urine. GSP ion selective electrode (ISE) was found to have superior stability, shorter response time, higher selectivity and sensitivity and longer shelf life compared to GSC ISE. GSP ISE showed the best Nernestian slope as well as the lowest detection limit. Moreover, the inherent advantages of screen-printed electrodes technology (low sample consumption, low cost and point of care testing) make this methodology very attractive in this field. As a result, the developed ISEs can be the best choice for in-line determination of gatifloxacin in urine samples to detect overdose intake and its associated symptoms as well as for quality-control laboratories without pre-treatment or separation steps."

In this paper, we describe and characterize the validation of a new colorimetric procedure for the quantification of the calcified component of the fish scale. This method is based on the use of alizarin red S (ARS) that specifically binds calcium of the bone matrix and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chelating agent that competes with ARS for the binding of calcium. The release of ARS from the scale can be quantified by measuring the absorbance of the alizarin red contained in the EDTA extraction solution since it is proportional to scale calcium content, then it can be considered an index of the degree of mineralization of the scale itself. This new method has been proved to be accurate, precise, based on linear regression and allows a great characterization of scale mineral content. Then, it can be very helpful to evaluate the mineral alterations induced by different pathologies in bone metabolism studies."

An optimum amount of polyclonal anti-AFB1 antibody was immobilized on MNPs (40 μg/mg MNPs). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate of AFB1 was prepared. A competitive immunoassay of AFB1 was performed. AFB1 in the sample and AFB1-FITC fluorescent conjugate competed for binding to the immobilized antibody on MNPs. The magnetic nanoparticles were removed using a permanent magnet. Fluorescence intensity of the unbound conjugate AFB1-FITC in the supernatant was measured. The excess of the conjugate is directly proportional to the concentration of AFB1 in the sample. The developed method is very rapid (30 min) and sensitive with the limit detection for AFB1 of 0.9 pg/mL and linear range of 1–100 pg/mL.
Effect of Silver Nanoparticles on the Fluorescence Properties of Levofloxacin in the Presence of Yttrium(III) Ions in Aqueous and Micellar Surfactant Media,"January 2021, issue 1",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821010147,ARTICLES,13 February 2021,"The effect of silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 4.3 ± 1.5 nm, synthesized by the borohydride method, on the fluorescence intensity of the fluoroquinolone derivative, levofloxacin, is studied. It is found that the addition of Y3+ ions to the system levofloxacin–silver nanoparticles increases the intensity of the antibiotic intrinsic fluorescence by 2.5 times. An increase in emission is possible as a result of the formation of a rigid structure of the fluorescent center, as well as the simultaneous action of the surface plasmon resonance of nanoparticles and an external emission source on the fluorophore. Carrying out a complexation reaction in the medium of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles on the simultaneous presence of silver nanoparticles ensures a fourfold increase in the fluorescence signal because of the self-organization of supramolecular structures in the solution. Fluorimetric procedures for the determination of levofloxacin in natural water and a medicinal preparation are proposed. The linearity range of the calibration graph is 1.0 × 10–9–1.0 × 10–6 М. The limit of detection is 3.0 × 10–10 M (3σ)."
A Study to Explore Discriminative Power of Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy for Forensic Paper Analysis Using Decision Tree Method,"January 2021, issue 1",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821010068,ARTICLES,13 February 2021,"Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is one of the preferred techniques for the analysis of forensic samples. However, the potential of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy for the classification of papers has not been established and remains unclear. In this work, a total of 150 ATR-FTIR spectra of white copy paper of three different manufacturers were analyzed using two advanced statistical methods, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA) and classification and regression tree (CART). Based on simple visual examination alone, the IR spectra did not allow any definite discrimination. However, the IR spectral differences between the papers were revealed by PCA and CART methods. A region at 1500–1200 cm–1 was determined to be the most discriminative. In conclusion, coupling of IR spectrum and CART provides a novel and non-destructive alternative for solving classification tasks in forensic context."

In the present study, we develop an approach yielding a reliable value of the specific activity of 232Th and 238U by a single measurement of a sample with the smallest deviation from the true value. We used a bottom sediment sample, taken during the 66th cruise of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh research vessel in the Kara Sea (station coordinates: 72°30.4' N, 80°20.4' E; depth 14 m), as a model sample. When processing the results, only those lines were selected from the entire set of lines belonging to the 232Th natural series, the quantum yield of which exceeded 2% (taking into account branching). When analyzing the natural 238U series, we selected lines that were free from interference with nuclides of the 232Th series and with the quantum yield above 3%."

An optimization of the reference methodology by gas chromatography was conducted based on the construction of calibration curves for each biodiesel during fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) quantification. Therefore, in the proposed optimized methodology, pure commercial standards are not necessary. Consequently, a reduction in the research expenses is achieved, making this methodology a cost-effective alternative for FAME quantification. The calibration curves obtained for each biodiesel presented slope values between 0.5–0.7 and regression coefficients (R2) > 0.98 in all cases. These results were compared to those obtained by the conventional methodology. With respect to the validation of the optimized methodology, a comparison of the results obtained by this proposed methodology and the reference one is presented. Finally, a robust and promising technique to quantify FAME present in biodiesel was successfully developed in this study."
A Hollow-Cathode Ion Source in Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry,"January 2021, issue 1",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/76-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934821010135,ARTICLES,13 February 2021,"The paper proposes a new glow discharge ion source based on a hollow cathode. The proposed source produces a denser plasma than the previously used glow discharge sources. It is shown experimentally that the maximum rate of cathode sputtering of a conducting solid sample in a hollow cathode ~25 mm in diameter is achieved when the sample has the shape of a rod with a diameter of 2–4 mm and a length of 10–15 mm and is placed along the axis of the cathode cavity. If a cover with a hole is placed on the cathode cavity, a plasma bunch is formed near the hole (a “plasma plug”), which resists the flow of argon from the hollow cathode. The pressure in the discharge chamber decreases, and the glow discharge is concentrated in the cathode cavity. This results in a decrease in the background level in the glow discharge source by approximately two orders of magnitude. The mechanism of formation and extraction of ions from a glow discharge ion source is considered. The ions formed in the glow discharge plasma form two oppositely directed ion flows in the source, one of them with an ion energy of 100 eV or higher. These ions, accelerating in the region of the cathode potential drop, are directed to the cathode, bombard the analyzed sample, and spray it. The second flow of low-energy ions is drawn from the same region of negative luminescence and is transported in the opposite direction, that is, to the surface of the discharge chamber-anode due to ambipolar diffusion. These ions are extracted from a hole in the anode chamber of a conventional ion source by an accelerating voltage and used for mass spectral analysis. The use of a hollow cathode with a plasma plug, the effect of ambipolar diffusion, and a modified Pierce lens makes it possible to increase the luminosity of the glow discharge source by more than one order of magnitude."

The study was carried out using a custom-made time-of-flight mass spectrometer combined with a custom-made atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPhI) ion source coupled to an exponential dilution flask. Solvent vapor concentration in the nitrogen flow was 10–1–10–4%. Analyte concentration in the same flow was 10–3–10–6%. Exponential dilution was carried out using a heated exponential dilution flask with a magnetic stirrer. The temperature of the flask, glass transfer line to the APPhI ion source, and of the ion source itself was 80°С. It was shown that, at the initial acetone and analyte concentrations in nitrogen equal to 10–1 and 10–3%, respectively, mass spectra of the solution vapors contained peaks of ions, such as [M–H]+, M•+, [M + H]+, [2M + H]+, [M + Mа• + H]+, [Mа + H]+, and [2Mа + H]+. When acetone and analyte concentrations in nitrogen were equal to 10–3 and 10–6%, respectively, mass spectra of each analyte revealed mainly peaks of the [M–H]+ ion for dibutyl ether and amyl acetate and peaks of [2M + H]+ and M•+ ions for propyl acetate."
Application of Carbon Matrices to Screening Pentacylic Triterpenoids in Plant Feedstock by MALDI Mass Spectrometry,"December 2020, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/75-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934820140026,ARTICLES,20 December 2020,"An approach based on the use of carbon matrices is proposed to obtain MALDI mass spectra of the most important secondary plant metabolites, pentacyclic triterpenoids (PCTs). The best results were obtained using carboxylated carbon nanotubes as a matrix; they form the most homogeneous solid phase with PCTs on a MALDI target plate surface. The cationization of analytes with lithium ions made it possible to obtain the most intense signals in the mass spectra of betulin, lupeol, and betulinic acid and ensured limits of detection for these analytes at a level of 15–25 ng. Because of the occurrence of side processes of the hydration and dehydration of cationized molecules, as well as of the replacement of labile protons by lithium ions, the resulting mass spectra are characteristic for various classes of PCTs and allow their reliable detection without using tandem mass spectrometry. The developed approach was successfully tested on real samples of birch bark extracts, and also on extracts from cranberry and lingonberry peels."

With the help of pulse voltages arranged as trains of a special type, a relay-switched sequence of axial distributions of the pseudopotential can be organized along the axis of the system in the form of space waves with alternating maxima and minima, which convey charged particles along the conveying channel. The disadvantage of the proposed conveying technology is the obligatory presence of neutral gas in moderate amounts, which dampens the excess kinetic energy acquired by charged particles in the jump-like switching of the radio-frequency electric field. An advantage of the proposed conveying technology is the simplified form of radio-frequency voltages applied to the electrodes of the device and the flexible control of the guiding velocity in Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry interfaces, for example."

We described an algorithm for selecting the optimal collimating system for a mass analyzer, which makes it possible to decrease this aberration effectively, with minimal loss in the intensity of the mass spectral lines. The algorithm is based on the representation of the considered aberration in the phase space as an ellipse and the optimal approximation of this aberration ellipse by a polygon with a given number of vertices. In the absence of constraints, the solution of the corresponding optimization problems is in phase polygons generated by regular polygons inscribed in a unit circle or circumscribed around a unit circle with the same number of vertices. After that, the unit circle along with the polygons is “stretched” to the size of the specified aberration ellipse along its main axes. Additional freedom of the rotation of the original polygon around the center of the unit circle can be used to position auxiliary slits of the collimating system more conveniently."

Another reason is in the low yields of such ketals on the interaction of ketones and diols under the conditions of conventional acid catalysis. To optimize the synthesis of trace amounts of such ketals, we used cobalt(II) bromide and dimethyl glyoxime as catalysts. The simplest chromatographic parameters, including the difference between the retention indices of the products and the starting compounds (difference in retention indices, DRI), are effective for identifying the target ketals in reaction mixtures. Such combined chromatography–mass spectrometric characteristics as homologous increments of retention indices (iRI) are informative not only for the group identification of analytes (assignment to the corresponding homologous series) and the assessment of their molecular weights (at low-intense signals of molecular ions). They are also useful for the determination of the total number of branches of the sp3-carbon skeleton of molecules (N) using the regression of N ≈ aiRI + b."

With the resolution of one of the devices several thousand at the base of the 3He+ mass peak, its absolute sensitivity is <106 atoms of this isotope in the volume of the mass analyzer chamber (~2.5 L), and the 3He/4He isotope ratio measured in a single experiment can be as low as 109 and even 1010. Another device of this type demonstrated resolution of more than 150 000 at the base of the mass peak, which ensured the detection of a 3He+–3T+ doublet. Excellent analytical characteristics of the MRMSs make it possible to use them to study the isotopy of helium in natural and man-made samples (solid, liquid, or gaseous) in meteorites and lunar soil, ferromanganese nodules from the bottom of seas and oceans, in ice cores from the well of Lake Vostok in Antarctica, in water from mountain streams of Mongolia and geysers of Iceland, in volcanic gases of Kamchatka and gases released from structural materials of a modern thermonuclear installation. In this work, we consider the principle and modes of operation of an MRMS and its design. The focus is on the details that distinguish these instruments from other instruments and ensure extremely high analytical performance, which is partly presented in the article."

It was found that ground steel target plates demonstrate the best results because of the uniform crystallization of analytes and good surface coverage. The most important ionization mechanisms for lignin oligomers with conjugated structures and increased acidity, along with protonation (cationization), involve the formation of molecular ions due to direct photoionization. For all of the studied compounds, partial in-source decay was observed, the contribution of which became significant at high laser fluence. The LDI method was successfully used to obtain mass spectra of low-molecular-weight products of the depolymerization of technical lignins. It was shown that the use of hybrid mass spectrometers with a quadrupole ion trap leads to an increase in the percentage of signals of protonated molecules in the mass spectra of lignin depolymerization products because of the occurrence of side ion-molecular reactions in the plume and ion trap."

It is proved that the Gaussian points of the optical axis of the mass analyzer are connected by a bipolar projection through two points – the poles of this projection, located on the straight lines passing through the optical foci of the mass analyzer parallel to the input and output arms of the optical axis. The distances of these poles from the foci adjacent to them are subject to the well-known optical invariant of Newton."

Diagnostics based on the analysis of exhaled gases offers several advantages over traditional laboratory methods. An analysis of a gas mixture is safe for the staff, because it does not involve chemical and biological fluids.

This paper discusses algorithms for the processing of mass spectra of exhaled gases obtained on an MC7-200 quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron ionization and the direct capillary injection of a sample. A comparative evaluation of algorithms for the detection of spectral lines in mass spectra based on data convolution with a model of response function or its derivatives is given. The Hermite function, the Gaussian function, and its even-order derivatives are considered as convolution kernels. The results of evaluation of the potential for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by algorithms of convolution with these functions are presented."

However, spectra of aromatic compounds with halogen atoms and nitro groups contain ion peaks with the composition not consistent with this postulate. Based on a detailed study of such ions by high-resolution mass spectrometry, we showed that their formation is associated with the reduction of the initial molecules at the metal walls of the ion source before their ionization. As a result, products of the reduction reaction of the corresponding composition are ionized. Nitro compounds are reduced to the corresponding amines, while halogenated compounds lose the halogen atom, turning into unsubstituted substrates. Water molecules on the metal surface of the ion source act as reduction agents. This process does not depend on the geometry of the source and proceeds in any mass spectrometer."

The relationships between the geometric parameters of the capacitors and the prism are given, which are necessary to ensure achromatic focusing of the ion beam in the plane of the detector receiving slit. We assessed numerically the effect of IOS aberrations on the mass resolution of the IOS and determined the optimal emittance of the ion beam at the source output, which enables achieving a resolution at the level of 3000–3500 with an output slit of the ion source of approximately 50 μm, high transmittance of the mass analyzer, small dimensions of the magnetic prism, and a moderate total length of the central ion trajectory (less than 1 m). The IOS is characterized by a high dispersion in masses, which is much larger than the dispersion of conventional sector magnetic mass spectrometers of the same dimensions. The IOS consists of simple geometry elements, which reduces the costs of its implementation and makes the mass spectrometer technologically advanced and convenient to set up and operate."

It does not require any special sample handling; it is based just on mixing an alcohol with a nitrogen-containing compound with high proton affinity. The resulting N-alkyl-derivatized cations appear in DART spectra as very characteristic and highly intense signals. In addition to the earlier used pyridine and quinoline, we propose a new reagent, 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (4-DMAP), having a higher proton affinity. It is shown that DART mass spectra recorded for alcohols in the presence of an equimolar mixture of pyridine and 4-DMAP reveal peaks that are mainly due to the 4-DMAP quaternization cation. This indicates a highly competitive ability of this reagent to get protonated and then predominantly participate in ion-molecular reactions with alcohols under study. It is suggested that 4-DMAP provides high sensitivity in the analysis of aliphatic and alicyclic primary and secondary alcohols."

This system relied on the aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) and its anti-aggregation in the presence of silver ions. APDC caused the aggregation of AuNPs which resulted in color change from red to blue. However, in the presence of silver ions, because of their ability to complex with APDC, the aggregation of AuNPs was inhibited and color change occurred in the opposite direction by increasing Ag+ concentration (blue to red). Under optimum conditions, this system exhibited high selectivity to Ag+ over other tested metal ions. This novel probe had advantages such as wide linear range (0.05–0.9 µM) and low detection limit (20 nM). The recovery analysis of river water as real sample confirmed that the proposed colorimetric sensor could be successfully employed in the determination of Ag+ in real water samples."

We present a modified crush-leach technique combining ion chromatography (IC) and total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF) which allows to determine a range of major, minor and trace elements out of one leachate. To date, trace element detection by means of TXRF is barely used in geosciences, although it combines the advantages of low to very low detection limits (µg/L to ng/L range), small sample amount needed (µL-range) and a fast and inexpensive analytical procedure. Previously described problems of adsorption of polyvalent cations at sample surfaces have been overcome by using acidified water as a leachate. Instead, it has been demonstrated that, for example, the syringe filter type used for IC measurements influences contamination and/or adsorption for a number of elements. The proposed method combination was evaluated for accuracy, reproducibility and system blanks and subsequently applied to quartz samples from hydrothermal vein deposits of the Schwarzwald ore district, SW Germany."

The solution construction process is stochastic and is biased by a pheromone model which is used to probabilistically sample the search space. ACO is a relatively novel technique for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. The inspiring source of ACO is the foraging behavior of real ants. Since wavelength selection is a strategy used for improving the quality of calibration methods, we investigated simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of two hazardous materials, namely, furaldehydes 2-furaldehyde (F) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), using ant colony optimization-partial least squares (ACO−PLS) regression. Predictive abilities of ACO in wavelength selection process were examined for spectrophotometric determination of these pollutants. Furthermore, ACO in combination with PLS was compared with other regression methods, such as classical least squares regression, principle component regression, PLS, and genetic algorithm−PLS, for F and HMF simultaneous determination. ACO−PLS showed superiority over other methods regarding the prediction ability of the resulted model and providing useful information about the chemical system. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of such hazardous materials as furaldehydes in oil refining wastewaters."

The monitoring of antimony concentrations in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles by XPS analysis is a new method for the characterization of bottled water contamination by antimony which frequently comes into contact with food and drink. The elevation of Sb concentrations in bottled waters is mainly due to Sb2O3 being used as a catalyst in the manufacture of PET. In this study, using a sensitive XPS determination of Sb in PET bottle materials, we observed that the water became contaminated with Sb during storage. Because the color of PET material may have an impact on the leaching of antimony, clear and blue PET bottle materials were analyzed separately and the results were compared directly. The main difference between the previous analyses and this study is that we analyzed only bottle plastic material rather than the water itself."

An original mass spectrometric criterion is proposed for the group identification of monoalkyl phthalates (assignment to a subgroup of homologues), which assumes the calculation of the total relative intensity of ion peaks at m/z > 170. In the mass spectra of monoalkyl esters, this value does not exceed 1%, whereas for dialkyl ethers, it varies from 1 to 172%. Within the set subgroups of isomers, it becomes effective to use the homologous increments of the retention indices, iRI = RI – 100x, where x = int (M/14), to refine the identification results. Using predefined iRI values and the ratio М ≈ 0.14(RI – iRI) + y, we can estimate the molecular weights of compounds in the mass spectra of which the molecular ion signals are not detected or are of low intensity (including monoalkyl phthalates). In addition, iRI values are in many cases informative for estimating the number of branches of the sp3 carbon skeleton of molecules (Z) based on regression relations of the form of iRI = aZ + b. The examination of homologous increments of the retention indices of dialkyl phthalates revealed an anomalous dependence of their values on the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl fragments of the molecules: from +125 (СН3) to –33 (С10Н21). In the subgroup of monoalkyl phthalates, such anomalies were not observed."

The proposed approach ensures a significant increase of the sensitivity of the voltammetric method for determining sulfite ions. The concentration dependence of the analytical signal is linear in the concentration range of \({\text{SO}}_{3}^{{2 - }}\)-ions 1 × 10–7–2 × 10–4 М (limit of detection 5.5 × 10–8 M). The results of the determination of sulfite ions in wines, beer, and juices indicate a higher accuracy of the voltammetric method compared to the standard iodometric procedure."

Therefore, it is inevitable that these TAGs will be part of Chinese medical preparations of Schisandrae chinensis fructus. It is important to identify TAGs in Schisandrae chinensis fructus. Fatty acids in Schisandrae chinensis fructus oil were identified by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC−MS) after transesterification. TAGs were determined by liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC−MS) and confirmed by high-resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT−ICR−MS). Seven kinds of fatty acids were detected in Schisandrae chinensis fructus oil of which linoleic acid (L) and oleic acid (O) accounted for 93%. Also, 7 TAGs were recognized in the oil. LLL, OLL, OOL and PLL were the main components (P corresponds to palmitic acid). The LLL composed approximately half of the oil of Schisandrae chinensis fructus by mass. The composition of fatty acids and TAGs in Schisandrae chinensis fructus was determined by GC−MS, LC−MS and FT−ICR−MS."

Among them, Vincristine (VCR) is prescribed for a wide variety of cancer types. Therefore, development of sensitive methods for VCR determination is urgently required. Here, a label-free and highly sensitive impedimetric biosensor was fabricated for electrochemical detection of VCR. First, multi-wall carbon nano tubes (MWCNTs) were dropped on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. Then, the VCR monoclonal antibody (Ab) was covalently immobilized on the MWCNTs via carbodiimide coupling reaction using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethyl carbodiimide and N-hydroxy succinimide. The step-by-step modification process was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry in presence of a redox probe [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–. The VCR concentration was measured through increasing impedance values in the corresponding specific binding of VCR to the Ab. The increased electron-transfer resistance (Ret) values were proportional to the concentration of VCR and the biosensor detected concentrations varied in the range of 0.2–50 nM with a detection limit of 8 × 10–2 nM (S/N = 3). Practical analytical utility of the proposed method was demonstrated by VCR determination in medicinal plant extracts and human serum samples with satisfactory recoveries. The proposed biosensor may be a promising alternative for screening of medicinal plants to produce VCR and for the determination of drug concentration in cancerous potions."

The invention of cluster primary ions significantly improved the sensitivity, especially in the mass range above several hundred of Daltons, which opened up the study of lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, metabolites, and drugs. As other methods based on the bombardment of sample surface with a particle beam, ToF–SIMS measurements are carried out under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, which makes sample preparation of biological materials a critical stage of the experiment. Several techniques have been developed for preparing single cells, cell cultures, and tissues for the analysis. Most of them are based on conventional techniques used in histology and cytology, including optical, electron, probe microscopy and electron probe microanalysis. However, the analytical features of ToF–SIMS make it necessary to adapt these techniques. A universal solution does not exist, and the main objective of this review was to systematize and compare the developed techniques of the sample preparation for ToF–SIMS. The effect of instrumental factors on the results of the ToF–SIMS analysis of biological samples was also reported."

The effect of minimizing of an anion-exchange affinity was detected when a solvating additive, heptyl p-trifluoroacetylbenzoate, was introduced into the organic phase. The effect of steric accessibility is not entirely lost due to the conservation of charge of the solvate. The introduction of a solvating additive improves the affinity of anions for the QAS phase significantly (up to 6.5 orders of magnitude). The effect of anion size on the effect of steric accessibility of the exchange center was found for sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate ions. An inverse relationship was found for the tetrathionate ion; that is, with a decrease in steric accessibility of the QAS exchange center, anion-exchange extraction is weakened due to the large size of the \({{{\text{S}}}_{{\text{4}}}}{\text{O}}_{6}^{{2-}}\) ion."

Synthesized materials were characterized with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies. The imprinted polymer was evaluated and applied as a sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with HPLC-UV to detect CBZ and its metabolite oxcarbazepine (OXC). The optimal conditions for molecularly imprinted SPE (MISPE) consist of the cartridge conditioning using methanol followed by triply distilled water, loading the aqueous sample and elution by methanol-acetic acid (9 : 1, v/v). The selectivity and sensitivity for pre-concentration and separation of the target analytes were studied in details, in order to build a simple and sensitive method which can act as a potential analytical strategy to monitor CBZ and OXC in the environmental and biological samples. The developed method exhibited a wide linear range (1–500 μg/L), good linearity (R2 > 0.990), and relative standard deviation <3%. The molecular recognition properties of the MIP gave rise to good recoveries for CBZ (87–98%) and OXC (72–78%) when spiked aqueous and bio-samples were percolated through the MISPE procedure.

This is explained by a competition between the reaction of the nucleophilic addition of a water molecule (with the release of H+) to flavylium ions with the formation of a noncolored pseudo-base (A) and the reaction of the deprotonation of flavylium ions with the formation of quinonoid structures (B), which are also colored with a certain bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum. It was proposed to estimate the applicability of the differential spectrophotometric method by comparing differences between the spectra recorded at different pH (1, 2, 3, 4, and 4.5). The method is applicable at the prevalence of route A, when the specified differences between the spectra are undistinguishable taking into account scaling. The method is inapplicable for the main route B, when spectral differences can be distinguished. In the second case, a simplified method for the determination of anthocyanins without the account of polymeric anthocyanins is justified."

Urine samples are a rich source of VOCs and they constitute a non-invasive tool for diagnosis of various metabolic and pathological states. The aim of this study was to optimize the headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (HS-SPME−GC/MS) method for analysis of urine samples on the example of urine collected from children with celiac disease. Pooled urine samples from three children with celiac disease were used to select the optimal fibers, time and temperature of extraction, salt dose, and pH to achieve the highest SPME efficiency. Analysis performed with the use of divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber in acidic pH with the addition of 1.5 g of sodium chloride supported the extraction of the highest number of VOCs with the largest total peak area. The extraction conducted at 60°C for 45 min led to an optimal improvement in efficiency with a reduced number of siloxane derivatives, indicative of degradation of septa, fiber, and/or GC column stationary phase. The optimized HS-SPME−GC/MS method can be successfully applied to the determination of VOCs in urine samples."

These values, obtained using standard values of the elution strength of solvents (from n-hexane to water), can belong to scales of relative polarity and hydrophobicity, including a variety of organic compounds of natural origin. It is proposed to use n-hexadecane and water as conditional boundaries of both of these scales, covering a range from 0 to 100. Variations in the averaged levels of the relative polarity of individual classes of natural mixtures of glycerophospholipids, which can be found after their adsorption liquid chromatography separation, depend not only on the composition of the phases used but also on the molecular species composition of lipids. A close relationship of these levels with the carbon numbers of individual molecules is shown."

Big data obtained by these techniques ensure multianalyte sample analysis, though the characteristics of the detection, identification, and quantification are satisfactory not for all analytes. The application of simple analytical systems can also be accompanied by the accumulation of big data volumes. A huge body of information is contained in big chemical databases, the use of which is necessary in non-target analysis. The selection of candidates for identification takes into account the prevalence (citation rate) of chemicals; identification includes the use of reference mass spectral libraries.

Limits of detection were (mg/L) 10 for borax, 35 for salicylic acid and 0.4 for nitrite and nitrate. Our PAD with a colorimetric method was also used for the determination of borax, salicylic acid, nitrite and nitrate in real food samples. Our detection limits were 3−5 times lower than those of commercial test kits, and the results from the real food samples were not statistically significantly different from those obtained via UV-Vis spectrophotometry at the 95% confidence level (t-test paired samples). Our proposed PAD can rapidly determine four chemical food additives in food with a high sensitivity and is an instrument-free technique."

The conditions of the potentiodynamic electrolysis of thymolphthalein providing the maximum difference in the oxidation potentials of quercetin and rutin equal to 136 mV are found. Thymolphthalein electropolymerization should be carried out in a 100 μM solution by the 10-fold cycling of the potential from 0 to 1.7 V at a sweep rate of 75 mV/s in phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.0. The electrode modified with polythymolphthalein is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance. It is found that the oxidation of quercetin proceeds irreversibly, and that of rutin, quasi-reversibly with the participation of two electrons and two protons and is controlled by the adsorption of analytes on the electrode surface. The analytical range is 0.025–1.00 μM for both analytes, and the limits of detection are 7.3 nM for quercetin and 4.7 nM for rutin. The selectivity of the electrode response to quercetin and rutin in the presence of inorganic ions, saccharides, and ascorbic and p-coumaric acids is shown. The developed method is tested on real samples (linden Tilia L. flowers and onions)."

The affecting factors include the geometry of the vessel for colorimetric samples, the manufacturing quality of the adjustment device (drawing of chess fields), the method of fixing the camera in shooting, the method of performing the blank experiment, the illumination of the sample in shooting, the degree of cropping of the edges of the photograph of the chess fields in its digital processing, camera specifications, and the mutual effect of chromaticity and turbidity on the contrast of the photograph and its mean-root-square brightness. It is demonstrated that for the design of the on-site photographic measurements it is enough to have a digital camera, an adjustment device, and a measuring vessel. Photographing can be done with a camera held in hands. An empty measuring vessel may be used as an optically transparent sample for the blank experiment.

Calibration with re-melted reference materials yielded more accurate calibration curves than calibration using the materials in their original state. Re-melting of the samples resulted in improvements in the XRF results in comparison to the reference values. This improvement is especially important in case of alloying elements with concentrations that determine the recognition of a specific solder grade."

First, the resolution of the components depends on the injector temperature (Tinj), which should not be lower than the boiling point (Tbp) of the solvent. Second, the retention indices (RIs) of the components eluted before the polar solvent zone are somewhat overestimated compared to the retention indices of the components eluted after this zone. And, third, the so-called “discrimination effects ” are observed for these samples, first of all, the dependence of the absolute peak areas of the components from Tinj. It is confirmed that such dependence does not affect the results of quantitative analysis by the method of internal normalization. Nevertheless, the possibility of using application of this and other methods is recommended, and the condition of Tinj ≥ Tbp should be satisfied to verify the thermal stability and mutual compatibility of the components of the test samples. These features are set in the analysis of both a solution of model analytes in 1,3-butanediol (Tbp = 207°C) and a sample of the food flavoring, which is a solution of a complex mixture of components in dipropylene glycol (Tbp 222–236°C).

However, because of the growing complexity of the mass spectrometers employed in these studies, there is an increasing need in robust and rapid quality control over the instrument performance. A variety of quality control tools targeting all aspects of LC–MS instrument operation have been developed recently. These tools are typically loaded heavily with a large number of metrics. Many of these metrics are difficult for interpretation for regular users without extensive instrumentation and/or data processing experience. In this work, we introduced a set of simple and intuitively understandable metrics for assessing the quality of proteomic analysis, including the total experimental time and the number of spectral scans, ion accumulation time and intensity in both MS and MS/MS spectra, charge state distribution for precursor peptide ions, and the number of sequential MS/MS scans, etc. These metrics are implemented as an open-source utility, viQC, freely available at hg.theorchromo.ru/viQC. The developed tool has been tested experimentally using data from three different Orbitrap instruments and demonstrated its capability for assessing the possible flaws in the instrument’s operation and subsequent improving the efficiency of proteomic analysis."
"Photocatalytic Degradation of Chlothianidin: Effect of Humic Acids, Nitrates, and Oxygen","December 2019, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819140077,ARTICLES,30 December 2019,"The use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been constantly revised because of their impact on bees, causing their decrease and bee malady. Unfortunately, because of the worldwide differences in pesticide regulation, chlothianidin is still allowed in European Union for greenhouse use and worldwide in some cases without any restictions. Lately, it was detected on soil particles and in raw and drinking waters. The preparation of drinking waters implies different purification processes, including chlorination, ozonation, and UV irradiation and nowadays advanced oxidation processes, including TiO2. The TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of chlothianidin in the presence of oxygen, nitrate, and humic acids was followed by kinetic studies, whereas the photoproducts formed were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The efficiency of different set-ups of the photocatalytic degradation of chlothianidin was evaluated by the identification of photoproducts and bioluminescence inhibition of bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The results indicate that less harmful photoproducts are generated in the samples with added humic acids."
On the Correct Averaging of the Equations of Ion Motion in High-Frequency Electric Fields,"December 2019, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193481914003X,ARTICLES,30 December 2019,"The pseudopotential approach is a useful tool for the qualitative description of ion motion in inhomogeneous high-frequency electric fields, often used in mass spectrometric devices. However, in the theoretical study of the motion of ions in high-frequency electric fields with close frequencies, mathematical ambiguity arises, caused by the nonequivalence of different mathematical approaches. The paper considers and compares the time-dependent pseudopotential model and the model of solenoidal (vortex) pseudoforces, that is, vortex drift. The vortex drift model in high-frequency electric fields with close frequencies can be replaced by the model of ion motion in a pseudopotential varying in time. The theory of almost periodic time signals with two characteristic time scales, fast and slow, eliminates the ambiguity in selecting the correct mathematical method for describing ion motion in high-frequency electric fields."

It was found that, in using tandem mass spectrometry, both precursor ions and product ions are involved in the formation of adducts with water. The main source of water for ion-molecular interactions in the ion trap is provided by buffer and collision gases. The role of metal cations in the formation of analyte adducts with water is noted. For the majority of the studied hydroxyl-containing compounds, hydration proceeds most actively in cationization with lithium ions, with the peak of the [M+H2O+Li]+ ion dominating in the mass spectra."

Such cations are readily detected by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Sulfonium cations were further studied by tandem mass spectrometry using collision-induced dissociation (CID). Typical and specific CID directions for cyclic cations formed from thiols of different structures are revealed.

The study of tandem mass spectra and of a composition of monomers formed in the collision-induced dissociation of lignin macromolecules showed the special role of p-hydroxycinnamic acids in the formation of nettle lignin. Based on the results of tandem mass spectrometry, possible structures of nettle lignin oligomers formed by the addition of guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units followed by etherification by p-coumaric, ferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are proposed."

The members of these series are not sufficiently presented in contemporary databases; an exception is provided by series (I) and (II), which are characterized with EI mass spectra (NIST MS Database, 2017) for 8 and 19 homologues, respectively. The data set includes EI mass spectra and gas-chromatographic retention indices (RI) on standard nonpolar polydimethylsiloxane stationary phases. Strong differences in the mass spectra of homologues of series (I) depending on the conditions of their registration are revealed. A comparison of RI values for alkyl chlorophosphates and thiophosphates allows the evaluation of increments for the hypothetic substitution of the oxygen atom in the P=O fragment with the sulfur atom (P=S), namely 59 ± 4 and 30 ± 4 for O-alkyl dichloro- and O,O-dialkyl chloroderivatives. The statistical processing of the so-called homologous increments of retention indices leads to average values attributed to a homologous series rather than to individual homologues. Using these values permitted us to evaluate the molecular weights of homologues for which no reliably detected signals of molecular ions are present in EI mass spectra."

This paper describes the development and validation of a technique for the quantitative determination of new compound PPI in rat blood plasma by HPLC/MS. The method of solid-phase extraction is applied to extract PPI from blood plasma in the process of biological sample preparation. The lower limit of quantification is 0.1 ng/mL with a linearity range from 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. By the developed technique, the sample analysis of rat blood plasma was carried out after the introduction of PPI pharmaceutical substance in a dose of 20 mg/kg, a pharmacokinetic profile of the substance was established, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in order to judge the degrees and rates of absorption and excretion of the new antiulcer drug in the blood of laboratory rats."

It is shown that none of them work: the best criteria have the 1st and 2nd kind errors close to 50%. Consequently, for all regions where carbonate oil source rocks are possible, a work similar to this should be done primarily, and only after such study, the analysis of oils becomes meaningful. It is also necessary to obtain quantitative estimates of the quality of all the other criteria used in petroleum geochemistry, for which such assessments are technically possible. New criteria should be designed only on the basis of those composition parameters for which the value of the Mann–Whitney test is close to zero."

The purpose of this work was to develop an approach that enables the identification of changes in the composition of inks that occur in the strokes over time and to determine the time dependences ensuring the evaluation of the time of application. The possibilities of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in revealing changes in the composition of inks of BIC Original, Corvina 51, and Pilot ballpoint pens were estimated.

It is used not only for potable water but also for, e. g., swimming pool water. Water chlorination is the most common method for eliminating microorganisms today. However, active chlorine reacting with natural and anthropogenic compounds dissolved in water gives rise to the formation of numerous compounds that may be hazardous to human health. The assortment of anthropogenic contaminants grows every year; UV filters are well represented among them. Since recently, they are referred to as ecotoxicants, while their application to skin protection becomes more and more popular all over the world. Over 30 compounds, including numerous halogenated derivatives forming in the aquatic chlorination of a popular UV filter avobenzone in the presence of inorganic salts of iron and copper, as well as bromides and iodides, were identified by gas-chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. The study demonstrated the notable variation of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the reaction products depending on the added salt. It is worth mentioning the formation of brominated and iodinated products."

The article discusses the results of calculations for the two-dimensional and one-dimensional decompositions of the charge distributions of cytochrome c with separation, presumably corresponding to different conformations of proteins.

Twenty-five proteins are identified; the features of reliably identified peptides are compared to those of the compounds that might be produced by trypsinolysis but were not detected. Two key factors enhancing a possibility of the detection of tryptic peptides are determined. One refers to the basicity of peptides in the gas phase, which is the highest for peptides with the C-terminal arginine residue; this reason for the emergence of significant analytical signals is well known. Another factor contributing to the ionization of peptides in study under MALDI conditions is their hydrophilicity. This result did not correlate with the most conclusions of earlier relevant studies discussed in the article."

To obtain trialkyl phosphites (RO)3P, insufficiently described to date, the pH of the reaction mixtures was adjusted by adding N,N-dimethylaniline (pKa 5.1 ± 0.1). The identification of trialkyl phosphites directly in reaction mixtures without preparative isolation implies a joint consideration of their mass spectra and gas chromatographic retention indices, provided that all other components of such mixtures are identified. The need to comply with this condition has led to the identification of several homologues of a previously uncharacterized series of 2-alkoxy-1,3,2-dioxaphospholanes, formed from a random admixture of ethylene glycol. The use of such combined mass spectrometric parameters as homologous increments of retention indices helps to distinguish trialkyl phosphites from isobaric dialkyl phosphonates; the compounds of both series belong to the homologous group of y = 12, y ≡ M(mod14). Despite the absence of molecular ion signals in the electron ionization (EI) mass spectra, the molecular weights of trialkyl phosphites can be estimated. In addition, a comparison of the homologous increments of retention indices shows that, compared with dialkyl phosphonates, trialkyl phosphites are significantly less polar."

They are of interest for the study of the regularities of chemical ionization and the prediction and interpretation of ion mobility spectra and mass spectra. Using quantum chemical methods, we calculated the structures and refined the isomeric composition of the H3O+(H2O)n ions. It was found that ions with n = 2, 3, and 4 have 2, 5, and 15 isomers, respectively. The most stable isomers, which possess branched non-cyclic structures with the H3O+ core, were determined. The thermodynamic parameters of hydration reactions of the most stable isomers of H3O+(H2O)n (n = 0–3) ions and the equilibrium composition of the reagent ion in a wide range of temperatures and concentrations of water vapor are computed. The obtained results agree with the available experimental and calculated data. Using the computed structural data and data on the composition of the reagent ion, its mobility was calculated by the trajectory method. The error of calculations is close to the experimental one."

The DBS samples on Protein Saver 903 Card substrates were shown to be stable for two months on storage at 22 and 40°C. It was found that the temperature of storage has a high impact on the stability of the DBS samples: the analyte concentration in the samples stored at 40°C was about three times lower than that in the samples stored at room temperature. It was shown that the special Protein Saver 903 Card substrates could be replaced by an ordinary blue ribbon filter paper. In the latter case, the tyrosine adducts of nerve agents were reliably determined in the DBS samples stored for a month at room temperature (22°C). However, for storage at elevated temperatures (40°C), the use of filter paper substrates is not recommended. The proposed approach to storage of blood samples allows one to take and easily transport large series of samples and automate their analysis."

Strains P. aureofaciens BS1393(pOV17) and P. aureofaciens BS1393(NPL-41) bearing various naphthalene biodegradation plasmids were used in the work. The strain BS1393(pOV17) contains the pOV17 wild type naphthalene biodegradation plasmid that determines the oxidation of naphthalene to Krebs cycle metabolites. The strain BS1393(NPL-41) contains the mutant plasmid NPL-41 governing the initial stages of naphthalene oxidation into salicylic acid. The limiting stages of phenanthrene biodegradation in bacteria with various plasmids have been identified according to the accumulation of intermediates. When bacteria were grown on phenanthrene, the main metabolites were as follows: (a) 2-hydroxy-2H-benzo[h]chromene-2-carboxylic acid/trans-4-(1-hydroxynaph-2-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid, (b) 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, and (c) salicylic acid. In the strain BS1393(pOV17), metabolite (а) was observed during 1–14 days of cultivation. Unlike it, in the strain BS1393(NPL-41), an insignificant amount of this metabolite was found after only 14 days. The availability of metabolite (b) in the growth of both strains was an evidence of the limited rate of its further decarboxylation. Metabolite (c) as a final product was found in the growth of the strain BS1393(NPL-41). Contrastingly, in the strain BS1393(pOV17), this metabolite was not found, which indicates the complete oxidation of phenanthrene."

The ternary complex was monitored by spectrophotometry at 532 nm. Variables affecting extraction efficiency were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit was 0.6 µg/L in the range of 2–300 µg/L with sensitivity enhancement of 55 after preconcentration from 15 mL of the sample, and precision was in the range of 2.5–3.9%. The accuracy was verified by the analysis of two certified samples and recovery studies of the spiked samples.

Apart from the advantages of simplicity and rapidity, the method is relatively green, accurate, precise, sensitive, has a high throughput, low cost of operation and maintenance and can be recommended for the quantification of caffeine in various common beverages."
Determination of Priority Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Water at The Trace Level,"August 2019, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819080082,ARTICLES,09 August 2019,"A procedure is proposed for the determination of priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in water by gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure differs from the known ones by the low level of the limit of determination, 0.1–1.0 ng/L and intra laboratory precision of 15–20%. A simple and rapid sample preparation procedure—a single extraction of PAH with n-hexane (sample volume 0.1 L, concentration factor 102–103)—can be easily implemented in routine analyses in monitoring research. The direct analysis of extracts eliminates the risk of losses of easily volatile PAH. Among the additional advantages of the procedure are small volumes of the extractant (1 mL) and the organic solvent, respectively, for its subsequent utilization. The procedure was tested in monitoring PAH in waters of Lake Baikal and its side streams and in the analysis of atmospheric precipitates on urban and background areas."
Selectivity of the Separation of Isomeric Chlorogenic Acids under the Conditions of Reversed-Phase HPLC,"August 2019, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819080057,ARTICLES,09 August 2019,"The selectivity of the separation of isomeric chlorogenic acids often found in natural samples (3, 4, and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3CQA, 4CQA, and 5CQA, respectively) under the conditions of reversed-phase chromatography on stationary phases of different brands, Kromasil (C18, C8, and C4), Symmetry C18, Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ, Nucleosil RPC18, and Diasfer C18, is studied. The results obtained favor the retention mechanism with predominant surface adsorption. The change in the selectivity of separation of a pair of 5CQA and 4CQA correlates with a change in the activity of residual silanol groups. At their low activity, the order of elution 3CQA < 5CQA < 4CQA does not depend on the mode (isocratic or gradient), the type of organic modifier, and the addition of an acid (formic, orthophosphoric) to the mobile phase. With an increase in the activity of silanol groups, the separation of the pair of 5CQA and 4CQA deteriorates up to the inversion of retention times. A Kromasil 100-5C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) was chosen for a reliable separation of three acids in plant samples (instant coffee, juice, and “Mate” tea)."

Various methods are studied for extracting PAHs from the matrix of a solid sample: extraction with organic solvents under mechanical stirring, ultrasonic treatment, and in a Soxhlet apparatus. The recovery depends on the method of sample treatment; it is maximum at mechanical stirring and extraction in the Soxhlet apparatus (up to 60–80%). The simplest method including mechanical stirring is optimal. A procedure for the quantitative separation of aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAHs in a wide concentration range is proposed using column chromatography on silica gel. The limits of detection for PAHs were 0.1–3 ng dry weight; RSD = 4% for benzo[a]pyrene at a concentration of 1 ng/g dry weight. The developed procedure was used to determine aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAHs in real samples of bottom sediments. The proposed option of sample preparation enables identifying and quantifying two groups of substances of petroleum components from one sample and thereby expands the possibilities of determining the source of hydrocarbon contamination of a water body."

These substances are used as neutral carriers (NCs) in membranes of ion-selective electrodes reversible to doubly charged carbonate and sulfate ions. The hydration of TFAP and some of its derivatives is systematically investigated. It is found that TFAP has higher solubility in water (partition coefficient D = 415) compared to those of p-MTFAP, DMTFAP, TMTFAP, and H-p-TFAB (D = 1360–2700), which makes it unsuitable as a neutral carrier for manufacturing membrane electrodes. H-p-TFAB is most strongly hydrated in an alkaline medium. It is found that p-MTFAP and H-p-TFAB form crystalline hydrates. The selectivity coefficients for the carbonate- and sulfate-selective electrodes are determined for all the neutral carriers studied; the selectivity of the electrodes increases in the series TFAP < p-MTFAP < DMTFAP < TMTFAP < p-BTFAP (p-butyl trifluoroacetophenone) < H-p-TFAB."

The voltammetric characteristics of analytes are most properly recorded on a glassy carbon electrode modified with CeO2 nanoparticles dispersed in anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate. The electro-oxidation of quercetin and rutin is adsorption-controlled and proceeds with the participation of two electrons and two protons. Under conditions of differential pulse voltammetry in a Britton–Robinson buffer solution with pH 2.0, the analytical ranges are 0.01–1.0 and 1.0–250 µM for quercetin and 0.10–100 µM for rutin with the limits of detection (S/N = 3) of 2.9 and 28 nM, respectively.

As nanoparticles can be particularly toxic to living organisms, the development of new approaches to the assessment of their behavior and mobility in soils is an important task. In this paper, the analytical possibilities of the dynamic extraction of CeO2 nanoparticles in a microcolumn (MC) and a rotating coiled column (RCC) are studied to evaluate the behavior of nanoparticles in soil. Differential and integral elution curves of CeO2 nanoparticles from the soil were obtained based on the data of eluate analysis by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. After pumping 100 mL of water through a microcolumn and a rotating coiled column, 0.15 and 1.37 µg of CeO2 nanoparticles are leached from the soil, respectively, which is 0.2 and 1.6% of the nanoparticles introduced. The ratio of CeO2 nanoparticles and soil mineral particles is two times higher in the MC eluate. It is found that the rotating coiled column enables the estimation of nanoparticles maximum mobility of nanoparticles in soil because of the minimization of the effect of its structure on their transport. The microcolumn, preserving the soil structure, ensures the estimation of the mobility of nanoparticles in a real soil column most accurately. We also studied the effect of the modification of the surface of CeO2 nanoparticles with citric acid on their mobility in soil. CeO2 nanoparticles modified with citric acid have higher mobility in soil compared to unmodified nanoparticles."

Herein, a label-free colorimetric method for determination of dopamine has been proposed based on the enhancement of the peroxidase-like activity of bare gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The assay is based on specific interactions between protonated dopamine and gold atoms through the catechol group, which induces aggregation of AuNPs and significantly enhances their peroxidase-like activity. The catalytic activity is evaluated by chromogenic reaction of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine with H2O2. The mechanism for enhancement of catalytic activity is discussed. The detection limit of dopamine was 25 nM by virtue of UV-Vis spectroscopy, and 0.21 μM by naked eye. The whole detection procedure can be completed in 15 min.

Application of Moving Average Filter for the Quantitative Analysis of the NIR Spectra,"July 2019, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/74-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934819070013,ARTICLES,08 July 2019,"This paper investigates the use of the moving average (MA) filter for the quantitative analysis of the near-infrared (NIR) spectra. The performance of the MA filter is mainly dependent on the right choice of the filter length. The paper also introduces a new technique for the determination of the appropriate length of the MA filter. The use of MA filters for the quantitative analysis of the NIR spectra has not been previously evaluated in the field of chemometrics. The effect of using several types of MA filters on the performance of the partial least squares regression (PLS) model has been studied and evaluated. The efficiency of the model was validated using different mixtures composing of glucose, urea and triacetin dissolved in a phosphate buffer solution. The results demonstrate that the use of a small filter length reduces the signal to noise ratio of the spectra, while the use of a larger filter length introduces a distortion and some information gets lost. In this paper, the exponential MA (EWMA) filter has been used specifically for the quantitative analysis of the NIR spectra for the first time. Its performance has been evaluated and compared to other types of MA and Savitzky- Golay filters. The results show that the standard error of prediction decreases from 35.6 mg/dL when 8 PLS factors are used for the PLS model to 22.4 mg/dL when 9 PLS factors are used for the EWMA−PLS model."

They consist in the anomalously strong dependences of the peak areas of even volatile components on the injector temperature, the solvents used and, to a lesser extent, on the amounts of injected samples. It is proposed to consider the following criteria for assessing the degree of manifestation of these factors: (1) the dependence of the absolute peak areas of different analytes on the injector temperature and (2) the analogous dependence of the relative peak areas of the same components in different solvents. In this case, the relative peak areas of various components in the same solvents remained almost constant regardless of the injector temperature. The above effects complicate quantitative determinations based on the measurement of absolute peak areas (the method of internal normalization and the determination of distribution coefficients in partition chromatography). For these purposes, it is preferable to use standard capillary columns with split sample injection at a sufficiently high splitting ratio."

It was found that the use of a molecular-statistical method and the AM1 semiempirical method for estimating the internal energy of molecules makes it possible to correctly predict the order of elution of isomeric dichlorobiphenyls. It was demonstrated that this approach can be used to confirm the assignment of peaks in a chromatogram to particular isomers.

Using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, we determined the structures of more than 60 suspected PVP metabolites present in human urine in both free and glucuronidated forms. Structural features of the metabolites were determined by interpreting high-resolution mass spectra and chromatographic retention in changing the acidity of the eluent. The compounds found are products of hydroxylation of propyl, pyrrole, and phenyl moieties, reduction of the carbonyl group to an alcohol one, carboxylation, the formation of keto groups, oxidative deamination, destruction of the pyrrole cycle to the primary amine, as well as combinations of these processes. Based on the results of measuring the relative heights of chromatographic peaks, an optimal set of metabolites is proposed for the subsequent routine screening of urine samples by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry."

It was observed that the impedance of electrode increased obviously after the electrode modification by glutathione, and the value of impedance was closely related to the reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration. Based on the fact that glutathione reductase (GR) could catalyze oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH rapidly in the presence of NADPH (β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate reduced), and as GSH was immobilized on the gold electrode surface, the impedance increased drastically. Meanwhile, it was found that the impedance was correlated with the activity of GR, and a chemical equation was obtained based on the relationship between the impedance and enzymatic activity. The range of enzymatic activity that could be measured at 0.005‒0.5 U by using this assay, and the detection limit was 0.005 U (1 U means reduction of 1.0 μmol GSSG per min at pH 7.2 at 25°C). The enzymatic activity of GR obtained by this method was compared with those obtained by colorimetric detection, and the results showed that the new method is reliable.

The dependences of the analytical signals of Ti‒DCCA and Ni‒DMG complexes on PANV‒KU-2 and V‒HOS and Mo‒PF complexes on PANV‒AV-17 on the pH of solutions in sorption in the dynamic mode are studied. The optimal pH value of the solutions for the simultaneous sorption of four elements is 3.5 ± 0.1. The influence of accompanying elements in the mixture on the determination of Ti, V, Mo, and Ni is studied.

However, to achieve this, it is necessary for the mass analyzer to operate in the spectrographic mode rather than in the spectrometric mode. It is known that the conventional Mattauch–Herzog scheme may operate in the spectrographic mode with double focusing (by both angle and energy) along the straight focal line but only in the first order. The usage of more complex optical solutions is prevented by the fringing fields of static magnets, which destroy the exact spectrographic mode of the instrument operation. It is shown in the presented study that by using the principle of the similarity of trajectories in Euler-homogeneous fields one can purposefully synthesize asymmetric fringing magnetic fields of a particular type, which keep the spectrographic mode and the straightness of the focus line for static mass analyzers. Such fringing fields and the corresponding fringing configurations of magnetic poles and screens can become a basis for static mass spectrographs of a new type with high optical characteristics."

An explanation of this empirical fact is proposed: the redox reactions induced by ionizing factors under the conditions of secondary emission experiments pass in the direction permitted for the particular initial form of the redox-active compound. Namely, an oxidized form undergoes reduction, whereas the reduced form is oxidized. This effect should be taken into account for the correct identification of redox-active compounds by their secondary emission mass spectra and for simulating redox reactions in the systems containing redox-active dyes under mass spectrometric conditions."
High-Precision Determination of the 238U/235U Isotope Ratio in Rocks by Multicollector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry,"December 2018, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/73-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193481814006X,ARTICLES,17 January 2019,"The paper describes the high-precision U-isotope analysis of rocks. The analysis is based on multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC−ICP−MS) and includes, as an essential part, the three-step ion-exchange chromatography separation of uranium from chemically complex solutions. In the analysis, the 235U and 238U mass-bias of the MC−ICP−MS is corrected against the reference ratio of 233U and 236U in a double-spike added. The doublespiking precedes sample chemical digestion. This approach is useful as it corrects isotope data for a possible U-isotope fractionation that could have occurred in the chemical preparation of samples. The double-spike 236U/233U is 1.03183 ± 0.00005. The extraction procedure ensures uranium yield of more than 80%. The accuracy of the analysis was estimated by the study of 238U/235U in an international standard sample IRMM-3184 as well as in monitor samples. The uncertainty was estimated at ±0.008% (2SD), which is comparable with the accuracy of the results previously published by foreign researches. The analysis was elaborated for studying natural 238U/235U ratio variations. It was used by the authors for the high-precision determination of the U-isotope composition in rocks (granites, shales, volcanic rocks) and U-bearing minerals."

Using this data, diagrams for transmission versus resolution are calculated both for the ideal quadrupole field and for the quadrupole field with round rods. It is shown that, using the dipole excitation mode, resolution may be increased from R0.1 = 1000 to R0.1 = 2200 with 20% QMF transmission in an ideal case, and, for the round rods, the dipole excitation along the isoline βy = 0.01 enables an increase in resolution R0.1 from 500 to 800 at a 20% level of transmission."

It is shown that the acylation of alcohols with nicotinic and quinoline-6-carboxylic acid chlorides gives derivatives with high desorption/ionization efficiency under MALDI conditions, and that the free acids formed as a result of the hydrolysis of anhydrides act as matrix compounds. The proposed approach is tested on a number of aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic alcohols."
Use of Molecular Weight and Elemental Composition as an Additional Constraint in Library Search,"December 2018, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/73-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934818140071,ARTICLES,17 January 2019,"Identification of organic compounds based only on searching against electron ionization mass spectral libraries is tentative. To increase the reliability of the identification, additional information should be used. Gas chromatographic retention indices, in addition to mass spectra, are most often used. Molecular weight and elemental composition is less frequently used, because additional experiments are required to determine these characteristics. In the present paper, we examined the influence of the molecular weight, elements present in a molecule and molecular formula on the results of the library search. It is shown that, determination of the nominal mass or molecular formula slightly increases efficiency of the library search (for example, probability that the correct compound occupies the first position in the list of possible candidates increases by only 2.8 and 3.0% respectively). On the other hand, use of additional constraints in the library search can significantly reduce the number of possible candidates and simplify predicting the absence of compound in the database."

This is a challenging task in the modern liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Existing approaches are based on the formation of tyrosine adducts with alkylmethylphosphonic acids after the cleavage of all proteins. The structure of such adducts is related to the type of the chemical agent used. This study demonstrates the possibility of detecting the tripeptide adduct of isopropylmethylphosphonic acid, obtained by trypsinolysis of the albumin adduct with sarin, in human plasma. The study of the pathways of fragmentation of the analyte ensures the identification of the characteristic features of dissociation that can be used to determine other biomarkers of the application of chemical weapons.

Appropriate variants of data presentation are analyzed. Based on the data on the common content of anoxia markers, a method has been proposed for answering the question of whether hydrogen sulfide contamination was permanent, covering the major part of the water column, or there was an episodic infection spread to a limited water layer. These data also allow the assessment of the role of organic matter formed under anoxic conditions in its total balance. A composition parameter is proposed that ensures the determination of the similarities in the conditions of organic matter transformation in different rocks."

The limit of detection of the procedure is comparable with the lowest level of endogenous TDG in biosamples (1 ng mL–1). Solid-phase microextraction of the derivatized analytes from the reaction mixture decreases the matrix effect. The procedure was tested in the analysis of rat biosamples obtained after in vivo exposure to sulfur mustard. The procedure was found to offer a higher potential in the retrospective determination of the total TDG and TDGO level in rat urine (within 7 days after exposure to 2 mg kg–1 of sulfur mustard) compared to the determination of the same markers in blood plasma. Blood plasma can be used for confirmatory analysis, provided the samples are taken within 2 days after exposure. Hair was found to be the least suitable biomatrix in view of the variability of the TDG background level in these samples and the possibility of contamination with TGD from other sources."

The results are obtained for a random sample of 100 mass spectra of 25 strains of S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and S. anginosus. The spectra were sampled from the database of 728 mass spectra of 182 strains for some Streptococcus species. Both approaches were proved to result in the similar identification as 80–88% of the true outcomes. For similar reference mass spectra and the same identification criteria, the results of identification were very close to each other as 24 agreements for 25 strains. This is because different estimations of mass spectral similarity included in the programs under comparison lead to a correlation of similarity indicators. The difference in usual identification results is mainly due to different reference databases and also different identification criteria."

In developing continuum models, integer indices are replaced by real parameters, and finite-difference relations are replaced by approximate differential relations involving derivatives. It is shown that this procedure is not reliable: the discrete model and the continuum model can diverge globally, even if for intuitive reasons it is expected that the models should be close. As a result, the transfer of the conclusions obtained for the approximate continuum model to the exact physical model can lead to conceptually significant errors and requires the investigator to be careful. In particular, the continuum model of the chemical kinetics of cluster formation and the continuum model of the pseudopotential of stroboscopic samples of coordinates and ion velocities in quadrupole radio frequency fields, considered as an example, are both insolvent."
A New Post-Chromatographic Derivatization Approach to the Identification of Alcohols and Phenols in Complex Mixtures by a Combination of Planar Chromatography and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry,"December 2018, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/73-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193481813004X,ARTICLES,17 January 2019,"A simple and suitable approach to the post-chromatographic derivatization in the analysis of alcohol and phenols mixtures by a combination of thin-layer chromatography and MALDI mass spectrometry was proposed for the first time. The chemical modification of analytes was accomplished by the treatment of eluted zones on thin-layer chromatograms by 3-bromopropionyl chloride in the presence of an excess of a base (pyridine or triethylamine). The resulting derivatives contained a residue with a constant charge (ammonium fragment) that ensures the efficient desorption of the derivatized analytes from the sorbent layer during MALDI. It was shown that the proposed approach allows the recording of mass spectra with a high signal/noise ratio and the detection of alcohols and phenols of different structures. The reproducibility of such MALDI mass spectra is rather high, which predetermines a possibility of building chromatogram curves using total or selected ion current and, hence, their visualization and treatment on the quantitative level."

It was found that, in aqueous solutions at pH 8.0 under aerobic conditions, quercetin forms double and triple donor-acceptor complexes of the composition {[Q][Q–H2]} and {[Q][Q–H2]2}, which can be separated by HPLC, but are rapidly converted to deeper oxidation products. In the presence of another flavonoid, luteolin (L), the oxidized form of quercetin also forms mixed complexes of {[L][Q–H2]} and {[L][Q–H2]2} types. Luteolin in the oxidation does not form donor-acceptor {[L][L–H2]} complexes. Quercetin in complexes with luteolin is always present in an oxidized form. It can be assumed that these complexes form as a result of the recombination of two radicals of flavonoids, which formed initially as a result of manifestation of the antioxidant properties (one-electron transfer). These transformations of flavonoids are possible if strict anaerobic conditions in their quantitative determination are not implemented."

A recording circuit based on a high-precision analog-to-digital converter was included in the new unit for controlling the separating magnetic field and measuring the ion current. In designing the system circuit, the task was not only to increase the sensitivity and expand the dynamic range when measuring the intensity of peaks in mass spectra but also to decrease the time constant of the analog part of the measuring system for the undistorted transfer of the ion current distribution form to the input of the analog-to-digital converter in a dynamic mode. A shielding system was designed that distributes the electric field gradient on the surface of a high-resistivity feedback resistor, which made it possible to compensate its distributed capacitance and decrease the time constant of the electrometric amplifier to 0.2 s. To compensate for the distortion of the shape of the ion current pulses, caused by the in-to-out stray capacitance of the electrometer’s amplifier chip, a special circuit was developed. This results in that the end-to-end frequency response of the new system for measuring and detecting ion currents is determined only by the upper cut-off frequency of the low-pass filters of 10 Hz. The high-speed measuring system made it possible to improve the mass-spectrometric resolution and mass accuracy and to increase full-spectrum scan rate. The working range of the new system for measuring and recording ion currents is 1 × 10–15 to 3 × 10–12 A. The measured equivalent root-mean-square input noise is 0.86 fA at the sampling frequency of 10 Hz and the integration time of 1 s and 0.14 fA at the integration time of 10 s."

The synthesized polymers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Variables affecting the solid phase extraction of Cu(II) such as pH, initial Cu(II) concentration and time were studied in batch experiments. Quantitative retention of Cu(II) on IIP was achieved at pH 7. The IIP selectivity for copper ion extraction was higher as compared to NIP in the presence of other competing metal ions.

It was established that, in the presence of even one chiral center in the alkyl fragments (for example, in sec-alkanol esters), dialkyl phosphonates were detected in the form of several chromatographic signals due to diastereomers with differences in the retention indices from 4 to 21. The four-coordinated phosphorus atom is the second chiral center. The homologous increments of the retention indices of di-n-alkyl phosphonates (iRI ± sRI = 29 ± 9) and esters having one (–4 ± 10) and two (–61 ± 14) branching points in the carbon skeletons of alkyl fragments were evaluated. These values, which were calculated based on data for a limited number of homologues, make it possible to characterize any compounds from the test series. It was found that the relationship М ≈ 0.14(RI – iRI) + y makes it possible to uniquely determine the molecular weights of analytes according to chromatographic data under the condition of rounding the results to the nearest value of M comparable with y = 12 to the modulus 14 [М ≡ 12(mod14)]."

Also the effects of the electrooxidation of the thus deposited nickel nanoparticles and pH of the electrolyte on the voltammetric behavior were investigated. The good calibration curve of an acceptable rectilinear range is obtained at nano-NiOx/Au electrode in which nano-Ni was prepared by two potential cycles and subsequently electro-oxidized in KOH solution."
Recognition of Model Analyte Mixtures in the Presence of Blood Plasma Using a Mixture of Fluorophores (“Fluorescent Tongue”),"December 2018, issue 12",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/73-12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934818120043,ARTICLES,21 December 2018,"The paper is devoted to the development of a version of the fingerprint method based on the effect of analytes on the shape of the fluorescence spectrum of a fluorophore mixture. The model analytes were medicinal substances (amikacin, sulfamethoxazole, pyracetam, and chloramphenicol) and binary to quaternary mixtures of these substances in equal concentrations. The mixtures were recognized using a fluorophore whose fluorescence was quenched to different extent by different model analytes (CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots, Schiff base prepared from o-phthalic dialdehyde and polyethyleneimine, and also rhodamine B and fluorescein immobilized on silica nanoparticles to increase the degree of quenching – Rhod/SiO2 and Fluor/SiO2). The fluorophores were used as mixtures (“fluorescent reagents”) containing from one to four fluorophores. The classes of analytes were distinguished by calculating Mahalanobis distances on score plots of the principal component analysis method. It was found that it was more difficult to distinguish analyte mixtures in the presence of blood plasma than in a buffer solution and that the best fluorescent reagent was the mixture of all four fluorophores, which ensured the subdivision of 15 mixtures of 2–4 model analytes into seven classes. An alternative fingerprint method based on the use of UV absorption spectra allowed distinguishing of only five classes."

Dynamic preconcentration of phosphatidylcholine on mesoporous adsorbents is described using the dynamic model for convex adsorption isotherms. An increased efficiency of adsorption preconcentration on nanostructured adsorbents is achieved through the more complete use of the adsorption capacity while reducing the loss of the analyte under dynamic conditions."
Molecularly Imprinted Polymer for Selective Extraction of Tartaric Acid,"September 2018, issue 9",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/73-9,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934818090046,ARTICLES,05 September 2018,"A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthetized through precipitation polymerization method for the detection of tartaric acid. Acrylamide or methacrylic acid as functional monomers as well as amount of cross-linker were regarded as polymerization variables. The reactants were dissolved in acetonitrile-ethanol (8 : 2) solution. The synthetized polymers were characterized by HPLC, fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), thermogravimetric and dynamic light scattering techniques. Batch adsorption experiments with control by HPLC revealed better binding capacity of acrylamide-based polymers compared to methacrylic acid polymers in phosphate buffer saline solution as binding medium. Highest binding capacity was obtained at 30 : 1 cross-linker to template ratio. Tartaric acid complexation with acrylamide was affirmed by FTIR. Tartaric acid is the dominant acid in red grape and can be utilized as red grape juice “fingerprint” in other juices like pomegranate juice which is known to be adulterated in beverage industry. Based on the obtained results, this easily synthesized polymer for tartaric acid can be used in the detection of the presence of red grape juice in pomegranate juice. The synthesized MIP can potentially be applied in sensors for tartaric acid."

Migration of Sulfur in the X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis of Rocks,"July 2018, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/73-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934818050052,Articles,04 July 2018,"The intensity of the analytical SKα line in the determination of the concentration of sulfur in rocks by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry constantly increases in the course of measurements. The reason for such change may be the directed drift of sulfur ions to the sample surface under the influence of primary X-radiation. This phenomenon is visually demonstrated by an experiment in which a sample is measured first on one side and then on the other side. The intensity of the analytical line from the back side of the tablet in this case begins to increase just from the same level as in the initial measurement from the fore side. A mechanism of the directed drift of sulfur to the sample surface is proposed. A positive potential forms at the sample−vacuum interface because of the lack of negative sulfur ions near the surface, part of which primary X-ray photons knock out of the sample. Under the effect of this potential, sulfur ions from the lower sample layers and also ions escaped from it come to the surface layer of the sample. To ensure the reliability of the results of the quantitative determination of sulfur, one should measure the intensity of its analytical line from two sides of the sample and use the average value as the result."

The adsorption isotherm of iron(II) tris(1,10-phenantrolinate) on the PET surface is described by the Langmuir equation and is linear in the concentration range in solution from 0.02 to 0.7 mM. The method for calculating the thermal perturbation in surface-absorbing solids was used to interpret the results of the adsorption study, and a possibility of determining iron(II) tris(1,10-phenantrolinate) on the surface at a level smaller than a monolayer was shown. Thermal lens spectrometry enables the determination of the absorption of the surface layer at a level up to 5 × 10–5 absorbance units, which corresponds to the surface concentration of iron(II) tris(1,10-phenanthrolinate) 2 × 10–13 mol/cm2. Using the example of the adsorption of 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol on the PET surface, it is demonstrated that, in the case of strong absorption of the surface layer, the thermal destruction of substance and the deformation of the substrate may occur. A local increase in temperature in the layer is also confirmed by theoretical calculations."

The spectral effects due to the formation of different Cl, Na, K, Ca, Mg-containing polyatomic species interfering with the determination of a number of elements like As, Se or Ni during the oaTOF-ICP-MS analysis are negligible. Under the optimum experimental extraction conditions evaluated using a fractional factorial design (10 mg of the sample extracted with 5 mL of 140 g/L NH4F for 10 min at 200°C), analysis of the resulting supernatant with Rh as an internal standard enabled precise and accurate simultaneous determination of 11 elements (Li, Be, Ni, As, Se, Rb, Sb, Cs, W, Tl and U) at trace and ultratrace levels. The accuracy was assessed by analysing two certified reference materials, namely Fine Fly Ash CTA-FFA-1 and Constituent Elements in Coal Fly Ash Standard Reference Material® 1633b. The precision of the reported method was better than 10%."

Some physicochemical characteristics of the complex were determined, the specificity of the reaction with respect to diphenhydramine was studied, and the probable complexation scheme was proposed. It was found that the molybdenum–gallein–diphenhydramine complex forms at a component ratio of 1: 2: 2.

Measurements were performed on a modified Jackson turbidimeter. It was shown that, in the RGB space, the contrast of a photo image of an alignment template is a chromaticity characteristic suitable for measuring turbidity. The interference of the yellow color of suspensions in measurements of turbidity was eliminated in the green channel. A correlation equation was found for the contrast (degree of turbidity) and concentration of the suspension. The equation does not differ from that of the law of light absorption. Performance characteristics of the determination of the kaolin turbidity of water were estimated in comparison with those of conventional turbidimetry. It was shown that, despite the primitiveness of the instrumentation for the proposed method of photographic turbidimetry, its characteristics are not inferior to those of classical turbidimetry."

The sensitivity of thermal lens measurements at the wavelength of the exciting radiation 532.0 nm is comparable to that of solid-state spectrophotometry in the region of the maximum absorbance of Nafion (275 nm). However, the high locality of thermal lens spectrometry (the area of the signal generation zone is 100 μm2) ensures the estimation of the uniformity of the deposition of the polyelectrolyte layer. To increase the absorbance of the layer of the applied polyelectrolyte, the latter is saturated with a colored compound (ferroin). The adsorption of ferroin into the Nafion layer on the PET surface was confirmed; the absorbance of ferroin in the Nafion layer is in the range of 1 × 10–5–5 × 10–4 units of absorbance, which corresponds to the surface concentration of ferroin 1 × 10–11–4 × 10–10 mol/cm2."

Under optimized conditions, the systematic errors in the analysis of model mixtures did not exceed 30 rel. %. They may be due to either the difference in molar absorption coefficients, or the delayed formation or instability of some azo dyes, and also due to the influence of reducing agents and arylamines. The procedure may become a good alternative to the determination of the phenolic index of sewage waters by the reaction with 4-aminoantipyrine."

The distribution constants (P) of pesticides between hexane and a polar phase are calculated. Based on the distribution constants of pesticides, a possibility of using distribution chromatography for their identification was considered. It is demonstrated on an example of pesticides with similar retention times that the hexane–water extraction system is most selective and universal for the identification of most compounds by gas and liquid chromatography. Using this system, logarithms of distribution constants of the substances under consideration are maximally differentiated and ranged from–1.32 to 8.0. Such a range makes it possible, with an acceptable volume ratio of the hexane and water phases (up to 1: 500), to achieve a significant decrease in the peak area of the pesticide in hexane when it is washed with water in accordance with its P value up to logP = 3.0. In the case of more hydrophobic pesticides, extraction systems of hexane–ethylene glycol, hexane–acetonitrile, and hexane–mixtures of acetonitrile with water and ethylene glycol can be used."

Autoclave decomposition is carried out in a mixture of HF and HNO3 at a temperature of up to 220°C and a pressure of up to 160 atm using a developed system with resistive heating. Subsequent evaporation to dry salts ensures the removal of F– ions and silicon as SiF4. The residue is dissolved in a mixture of HCl and H2O2 at 160°C under elevated pressure. The resulting solutions (10% with respect to HCl with the addition of H2O2) are diluted before measurements. The dissolution process is monitored for each sample using stable highly enriched isotopes of 91Zr, 100Mo, 149Sm, and 178Hf. The second procedure is based on fusing samples with a mixture of Na2CO3 and Na2B4O7 at 1050°C in a muffle furnace and dissolving the resulting melt in a mixture of HCl and H2O2.

The possibilities of initial polymer thioethers in selective preconcentration and the acceleration of sorption through the introduction of nitrogen-containing groups into thioethers are considered. The dependence of the selectivity of sorbents on the nature of radical at the nitrogen atom is revealed. The use of aminothioethers with different substituents at the nitrogen atom enables distinguishing the groups of noble metals, toxic elements of arsenic and selenium subgroups, and a number of nonferrous metals in the presence of large excesses of other elements. A high recovery of the elements to be determined into the sorption preconcentrate and the selectivity of the sorbents help to improve the accuracy of the analysis. Prospects for the use of aminothioethers are considered on an example of sewage waters. It is found that the extraction of small concentrations of elements from large volumes of solutions is more convenient to carry out in dynamics, for which powdered aminothioether sorbents are not suitable. To ensure a possibility of using aminothioethers in dynamics, a “snake in a cage” synthesis method is used, in which the inert granular support is modified with aminothioether moieties. The introduction of aminothioethers with different radicals at the nitrogen atom makes it possible to combine sorbents selective with respect to different groups of elements on one carrier and thus to create a universal sorbent with predetermined properties, aimed at extracting certain metals."

The main advantage of the considered method of analysis is the stability of the intensity ratio between diagnostic analyte lines in the wide range of currents of the electron probe and gas phase pressure in the chamber in the range 60–130 Pa, sufficient for obtaining undistorted images of the surface of dielectrics. The stability of the intensity ratio ensures obtaining correct data of the quantitative analysis of nonconducting samples without the deposition of conducting coatings. The main features of low-vacuum microanalysis for the range of gas phase pressures used are discussed, which can create additional difficulties in the study. Among such features is a possibility of the manifestation of reflexes of gas-phase elements, significant underestimation of the relative emission intensity from lighter elements in the composition of the studied samples, loss of scanning locality in the analysis of small sites on the sample surface. An example of the correct quantitative elemental analysis of a dielectric surface without the deposition of an electroconductive coating for a number of aluminosilicates is presented."

The nanohybrid has been synthesized by decorating platinum palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (Pt‒PdNPs) on graphene nanosheets (G/Pt‒PdNPs). Field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical measurements and UV-Vis spectrophotometry have been used to characterize the nanocomposite. An ethanol oxidation current of 332 μA was obtained with the use of G/Pt‒PdNPs modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) that is 167 times higher than that of bare GCE in cyclic voltammetry studies with a potential scan rate of 50 mV/s in 0.1 M NaOH as the supporting electrolyte. Chronoamperometry studies have shown a distinct increase in the current for increasing concentration of ethanol with a wide range of linearity extending from 5 mM to 3 M and a detection limit of 1 mM with the use of G/Pt‒PdNPs. Quantum mechanical modeling using density functional theory was used to arrive at the minimization energies of G/Pd, G/Pt and G/Pt‒Pd in the presence and absence of ethanol. The improved catalytic activity of G/Pt‒PdNPs nanocomposite for ethanol detection is on account of the cooperative effects of Pt and PdNPs, coupled with the high conducting nature of graphene."

Analytes are washed with acetonitrile from the studied surface and then analyzed by HPLC−MS with electrospray ionization or the matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). For electrospray ionization, the limit of detection is 6 μg/L and for MALDI ionization, 2 μg/L. The MALDI technique also ensures the direct investigation of samples without washing out; in this case, mass spectra can be visualized by constructing 2D diagrams of the distribution of nitrobenzoic acids over the surface."

The effect of the nature and concentration of surfactants in the composition of the electrode surface modifier on the amperometric response of thymol was evaluated. It was found that the best voltammetric characteristics are achieved in the case of an anionic 0.10 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (a decrease in oxidation potential by 50 mV and an increase in oxidation currents 2.2-fold in comparison with MWCNT-COOH/GCE). The electrooxidation of thymol at MWCNT-COOH–SDS/GCE proceeds irreversibly with the participation of one electron and one proton and is controlled by the adsorption of the analyte. The electrode response is linear in the ranges 0.500–17.0 and 17.0–150 μM of thymol with the limits of detection 0.14 μM and determination 0.48 μM. The developed method is tested on thymol-containing pharmaceutical preparations. The voltammetry data are compared with the results of an independent spectrophotometric determination.

The most common procedure includes chlorination, which efficiently eliminates microorganisms. However, the reaction of active chlorine with dissolved organic matter produces numerous organochlorine compounds posing a hazard to the environment and human health. UV filters belong to emerging contaminants, as their application to skin protection from UV irradiation becomes increasingly popular all over the world. Certain components of UV filters were detected in swimming pools and result in the emergence of new ecotoxicants. In the present study, 40 compounds, including numerous brominated derivatives, which result from the chlorination of avobenzone in sea water, were identified by gas chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry. In addition, the applicability of photocatalysis to the destruction of chlorination products was studied. The procedure was found to be rather efficient and allows a decrease in the total amount of avobenzone transformation products by a factor of 10.

In this analysis, reversed phase HPLC (RPHPLC) using non-polar stationary phases such as surface-modified silica containing alkyl groups (e.g., C18) is typically employed. Because of the high heterogeneity of proteomic samples, multidimensional separation approaches gained increasing attention recently to tackle this complexity and extremely high range of concentrations. In two-dimensional liquid chromatography, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is often a method of choice for combination with RP-HPLC because it uses reversed-phase type eluents and allows efficient separation of polar peptides. Due to the high degree of orthogonality in this two-dimensional separation space, it is tempting to develop approaches for predicting peptide retention times for HILIC-based separations similar to the ones for RP-HPLC. Recent successful efforts in this area were focused on developing retention coefficient (RC)-based approaches. Herein, we explored the feasibility of using a statistical thermodynamic model for prediction of peptide retention times in HILIC separations and determined the phenomenological parameters of the model for a bare silica column. The performance of the developed model was tested using HPLC-MS analysis of a set of synthetic peptides, as well as a tryptic peptide mixture."

They are present in the original samples and produced by the reaction with air oxygen molecules, resulted in their accumulation in samples under analysis. A higher sensitivity of MALDI detection is observed for less hydrophobic LPCs as compared to more hydrophobic PCs; this phenomenon is explained. The hydrophobicity/ lipophilicity factor is also revealed in replacing the matrix of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid by α-cyano-4- hydroxycinnamic acid. The latter matrix is rarely used in MALDI detection of lipids and may be suitable for the selective determination of LPCs and oxidized LPCs."

However, experimental studies of the mechanism of amyloid formation by proteins and the structural characteristics of amyloids are complicated because of the heterogeneity and high molecular weight of the aggregates. We used limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry for the identification of regions in the apomyoglobin polypeptide chain, which give rise to intermolecular interactions in amyloid structures. Tandem mass spectroscopy enabled the identification of regions in the myoglobin polypeptide chain, which form the core of amyloid structures. It was shown that the main structural elements for the formation of the core of amyloid fibrils in myoglobin were regions from 60 through 90 and from 97 through 124 amino acid residues. These regions coincide well with those theoretically predicted. This approach yielded important data on the structure of protein molecules in aggregates and on conformational rearrangements of apomyoglobin upon amyloid formation."

No additional matrix compounds are necessary to register MALDI mass spectra, because the excess of the derivatization agent plays the role of a matrix. MALDI mass spectra demonstrate high efficiency of desorption/ionization of the derivatives. To discover reactive matrices, a set of aromatic primary amines (mainly substituted anilines) has been tested, but they have not demonstrated matrix properties."

Collisionally induced decay mass spectra (positive mode) revealed different patterns depending on the charge of the parent ion, attached cations (or ions), the composition, and the sequence of carbohydrate fragments. The most intense peaks (two series) originated from the sequential cleavage of glycoside bonds resulting in charge location on the reducing end (Y series observed for all of the test compounds) or nonreducing end (B series). Hexaethylene glycol chain fragmentation giving rise to the cleavage of the C–O bond remote from the biotin moiety was observed. Other fragment ions lighter than the above by a difference of (C2H4O)

Similar fragmentation was found for all of the nonsulfated biotinylated glycosides with the hexaethylene glycol spacer thus demonstrating that this type of fragmentation was characteristic of such molecular probes.

The paper describes the ability of such a supersonic jet to conserve an additional energy of jet gas atoms. A significant influence of the temperature of the gas flow on the yield of cyclohexane fragment ions was found, cyclohexane being an admixture in the noble gas jet passing through an electron ionization ion source.

The dependence of aberrations on ion energy acquired toothed shape for the resolution of the analyzer higher than 3000–5000. The approximation of the dependence gave a 15th degree polynomial. The calculation of polynomial coefficients showed a great contribution to the duration of ion packets for aberrations of higher order. The discovered features allowed us to suggest a way of the local correction of nearby trajectories in the total ion flux. By correcting the local motion of individual groups of ions, we could reduce temporary aberration to 1–1.6 ns, depending on ion energy. For the time of ion flight ~35 μs, such duration limits the resolution of the analyzer by a value not less than 10000. The real length of ion drift path was about 30 cm. The total overall sizes of the ionoptical system were ~24 × 19 × 5 cm."

Different selectivity of the separation of anthocyanins on phase I makes this separation version a good alternative to traditional reversed phase chromatography."

Upon thorough mechanical stirring of a solution, cyanuric acid was shown to form chiral supramolecular structures on the surface of adsorbent particles analogously to the Kondepudi formation of chiral crystals of achiral molecules. The enantiomers of 2-bromobutane and 2-chlorobutane were found to undergo, respectively, complete and partial separation on the cyanuric acid-modified Carboblack C adsorbent. The separation of enantiomers is due to a high enantioselectivity of the modified adsorbent. The analysis of thermodynamic functions of adsorption showed that the differences in specific retention volumes of enantiomers are caused by the fact that one of enantiomers is adsorbed predominantly within the cavity of the supramolecular structure of cyanuric acid and another one is adsorbed on its surface. Separation on the proposed chiral stationary phase is characterized by the relative standard deviation of retention volumes no more than 7%."

In determining the total concentration of mobile species of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Mn, and Mo, they were extracted with an acetate–ammonium buffer solution (pH 4.8) in the batch mode. Fractionation of the most mobile and environmentally relevant element species, that is, exchange and acid-soluble, was carried out in a dynamic extraction mode in a rotating coil column using calcium nitrate and acetic acid. Element concentrations in the initial samples and extracts were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry. It is shown that the concentrations of mobile species of Cd, Mn, and Mo, isolated with an acetate–ammonium buffer solution, correspond to the sum of these elements in the exchange and acid-soluble fractions, while the concentration of lead in the acetate–ammonium extract is 2–4 times higher. The convergence of the results of dynamic and batch extraction of copper and zinc depends on the type of sample: for sand, the results are in satisfactory agreement, while for soil, the concentration of copper and zinc in the acetate–ammonium extract is 2–4 times lower than their concentration in the exchange and acid-soluble forms. Nevertheless, the data obtained confirm that the conventional method of batch extraction with an acetate–ammonium buffer solution (pH 4.8) can be considered acceptable for the rapid assessment of the physicochemical mobility and potential bioavailability of elements in soil and technogenic sand. For a more detailed study of highly contaminated samples and the assessment of their danger to the environment, it is advisable to separate exchange and acid-soluble fractions."
On the limitation of the term petroleum products in the determination of the oil pollution of bottom sediments,"October 2017, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/72-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934817100161,Articles,22 September 2017,"Problems related to the determination of the oil pollution of bottom sediments are discussed. Tarry substances resistant to degradation, whose content can be as high as 50% on a total oil basis, are accumulated in the bottom sediments. The conventional term petroleum products, which implies only a hydrocarbon fraction, does not adequately describe these substances; because of this, the really evaluated level of the oil pollution of bottom sediments becomes underestimated to a considerable degree. We proposed to determine tarry substances in bottom sediments by fluorescence spectrometry at 490–510 nm in combination with a stage of the chromatographic preconcentration and separation of oils and petroleum products into the following main group components: hydrocarbons, tars, and asphaltenes. The substances coextracted with the petroleum products (pesticides, phenols, pigments, etc.) occurred in a chromatographic zone of tars and asphaltenes, but they fluoresce at other wavelengths and do not interfere with the determination. The typical chromatograms of hydrocarbons from the bottom sediments of different water bodies obtained by gas chromatography are given."

Such solutions are used, for example, in comparative dissolution kinetics tests in pharmaceutical practice. At some pH, the subtraction of the areas of system peaks from the total areas of analyte peaks made it possible to compensate for the negative effect of the solvent. To determine glucosamine hydrochloride in 0.1 M HCl, a procedure was developed and validated, involving the synthesis of o-phthalic derivatives. The revealed analytical features are caused by that the solvent of the samples and the eluent do not match; the effect can be most pronounced in measurements in the near UV region and in the determination of ionic compounds."

Vanadium(V) at pH 5‒7 is adsorbed on PANV–AV-17; when a HQS solution is applied to the disk, a yellowish green complex compound formed, which changed color to almost black after the treatment of the disk with a HCl solution. The presence of sulfo groups in the HQS molecule ensures the preconcentration of the reagent on PANV–AV-17 disks with the registration of an analytical signal after the treatment of the disk with NaVO3 and 0.1 M HCl solutions. A linear dependence of the analytical signal is observed in the HQS concentration range of 1‒10 μg/mL.

When ascorbic acid is applied to the disk with a vanadium(V)‒HQS‒HCl complex, the color changes from black to green. A test method for the determination of ascorbic acid is proposed. 8-Hydroxyquinoline can be determined by the intrinsic color of the adsorbate on PANV–KU-2 in the range of concentrations of HOQ solution in two drops 5‒100 μg."

The study of the chemical composition and properties of road dust nanoparticles is an urgent task of analytical chemistry, which needs to be addressed in the monitoring of the anthropogenic load on the environment and the assessment of the potential danger of pollution to human health. In the present paper, we propose a new approach for the isolation, characterization, and quantitative elemental analysis of road dust nanoparticles.

It is shown that the total concentration of most elements in the samples of Moscow dust is comparable to the average values for urban soils. Abnormally high concentrations of several elements (Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hg, Pb, Tl, and Bi) are revealed in the fraction of nanoparticles; the enrichment factor with respect to the total concentration ranges from 10 to 450.

In this work, we proposed a simple, fast, and green method for spectrophotometric determination of unsymmetrical 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) based on LSPR property of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). An LSPR band is produced via reduction of Au3+ ions in solution by UDMH as active reducing agent in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as a capping agent. Some important parameters in the formation of LSPR including Au(III) concentration, pH, concentration of stabilizer, and reaction time were studied and optimized. Under optimum conditions, the LSPR intensity displays linear response with the increasing UDMH concentration in the range from 0.5–10 μg/mL at 550 nm with a detection limit of 0.2 μg/mL. Also, the relative standard deviation for ten replicate determination of 5.0 μg/mL of UDMH was 3%. Usage of AuNPs as new nontoxic reagent instead of hazardous reagents in the spectrophotometric determination of UDMH is a step toward green analytical chemistry. The proposed method was successfully applied for determination of UDMH in water and wastewater samples."

As turn-on sensors have a superior level of selectivity than fluorescence quenching based sensors, we developed a fluorescence retrieval strategy for dopamine sensing. Here, highly fluorescent amino phenyl boronic acid (APBA)‒conjugated gold nanocluster (Au‒BSA‒APBA probe) has been synthesised from bovine serum albumin‒protected gold nanocluster (Au‒BSA NCs). Boronic acid forms boronate ester with disaccharides such as lactose due to its affinity to polyols. Hence fluorescence of Au‒BSA‒APBA probe is quenched when it binds with lactose molecules through boronate ester formation. The fluorescence of Au‒BSA‒APBA‒lactose system can be retrieved (turn-on) with dopamine by the competitive displacement of lactose from the probe surface which suggests the higher affinity of boronic acid to the catechol group of dopamine. Furthermore, real samples spiked with dopamine including human serum and urine were analysed using this turn-on sensor and showed excellent recovery percentage. The developed fluorescent sensor offered high selectivity for dopamine over other catecholamines and aminoacids with detection limit as low as 0.7 μM."

It was shown that, if the emitter in X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) is a disk 3 cm in diameter cut from the center of a filter 5 cm in diameter, the systematic error of the results of analysis may be higher than 0.30. Recommendations on the choice of the conditions of sampling aerosols and emitter preparation are formulated.

1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate/copper(II) as catalyst for lucigenin chemiluminescence and its application to glucose detection,"January 2017, issue 1",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/72-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934817010026,Articles,22 February 2017,"The present study reports the effect of an ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate ([Emim][EtSO
4]), on the Cu2+-catalyzed lucigenin/H2O2 chemiluminescence system in the range of pH 6.5‒10. At pH 8.0, the greatest enhancement on light emission is observed, related to a strong interaction between Cu2+ and the imidazolium ring at this pH. Furthermore, the formation of IL microdomains in the aqueous solution enhances in solubility of N-methylacridone, an insoluble emitter that can be very effective in lucigenin chemiluminescence (Luci-CL). The mentioned findings encouraged us to suggest a novel and simple method for the determination of glucose with the detection limit of 7 μM at pH 8.0 based on the detection of H2O2 liberated in enzymatic reaction between glucose oxidase and glucose by the [Emim][EtSO

General possibilities of the methodology proposed were demonstrated on examples of dialkyl sulfides, substituted thiacyclanes, dibenzothiophene, and methionine methyl ester. Various alkyl and aralkyl halides, as well as trimethyl- and triethyloxonium salts were tested as alkylating agents. S-alkylation was shown to proceed quantitatively under mild conditions. MALDI and SALDI mass spectra (a matrix-free nanostructurized target was used in SALDI experiments) displayed only ion peaks corresponding to sulfonium cations whose mass numbers were equal to the sum of molecular weights of sulfides and weight increments of the introduced alkyl and aralkyl groups. Trans-alkylation was observed for benzyl-substituted sulfides. Tandem mass spectrometry provided preliminary data on the fragmentation of ESI-generated sulfonium cations and demonstrated differences in the MS/MS spectra of regioisomers."

However, systems with good spectrographic properties significantly differ from the optical point of view from systems with good spectrometric properties, and the development of such devices leads to completely new optical problems and, accordingly, to novel methods of their solution.

New possibilities of dimethylformamide dimethylacetal as a derivatization agent for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis,"December 2016, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/71-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934816140161,Articles,16 February 2017,"It is shown that the use of dimethylformamide dimethylacetal for the derivatization of analytes in gas chromatography/mass spectrometry cannot be restricted by the known conversion of carboxylic acids, phenols, and thiols into their methyl esters (ethers), as well as by the conversion of non-volatile amino acids (and C-amino compounds of other classes) into their dimethylaminomethylene derivatives. The application of this reagent to the derivatization of hydrazine derivatives and volatile carbonyl-containing analytes is considered. In the last case, the reaction proceeds selectively via CH2 and/or CH3 groups in the α-position to the carbonyl fragment. The principal predestination of the derivatization of such analytes is their characterization by differences of gas-chromatographic retention indices (ΔRI) of reaction products and initial substrates. The ranges of variation of such increments, ΔRI, appeared to be different for different subgroups of carbonyl compounds; this allowed us to determine their structures more precisely. The mass spectra of C-dimethylaminomethylene derivatives of some carbonyl compounds, preferably 2-substituted 1-methyl- and 1-aryl-3-(dimethylamino) prop-2-en-1-ones, revealed intense [M–17] peaks. The appearance of these signals can be explained by the migration of a hydrogen atom and the formation of [М–ОН]+ ions."

The problem is solved by analytical methods. An algorithm for the construction electric fields ensuring particle motion along the desired trajectories is described. It is based on the method of physical analogies. The procedure is illustrated by an example.

The retention indices of these diimides are lower than those of initial hydrazones by 268 ± 26 i.u. The most remarkable feature of these isomers appeared to be the high identity of their mass spectra because of similar rearrangements in molecular ions."

According to the developers, its intrinsic property is discriminating short sequence length peptides. Therefore, elimination of direct comparisons between peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) for short and long peptides may potentially increase the search sensitivity for a given FDR level. In the proposed approach, all PSMs are grouped according to the number of matched fragment ions, followed by separate filtering of identifications in each group using target-decoy approach. The approach is applied to Morpheus output results and does not cause a significant increase in the overall data analysis time. The proposed approach was implemented as a Python command-line tool, called GroupFilter. Several data sets from different types of mass spectrometers were used for testing of the software, including the data from the original Morpheus search engine paper. Separate FDR filtering for grouped identifications increased the number of identified peptides by up to 18% compared with the default Morpheus post-processing procedure. The proposed approach can be considered as an addition to the Morpheus search engine."

Mass spectra of a series of monoalkyl phthalates (R = C1–C8) are discussed; their gas chromatographic retention indices on the RTX-5 polydimethylsiloxane stationary phase (5% phenyl groups) are determined. A linear dependence of indices on the number of carbon atoms in n-alkyl fragments of molecules and a correlation between the indices of any monoalkyl phthalates and corresponding diesters were used for the control of the data obtained. Using the last correlation, we found that most part of index values of mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate given in literature is wrong and, therefore, the results of identification of this compound in various samples must be revised. It was found that simplest monoalkyl phthalates are unstable during gas chromatographic separation, which may result in distortions of their mass spectra. To compare with monoalkyl phthalates, a similar series of monoesters of (Z)-butenedioic (maleic) acid was characterized. Retention indices of monoalkyl phthalates in reversed phase HPLC were determined and discussed."

The method ensures the analysis of samples without their transfer into solution and with high spatial resolution, up to several micrometers. The main restriction of laser sampling is due to elemental and isotopic fractionation, proceeding in the interaction of laser irradiance with the sample surface, on which photoelectronic and thermal processes, resulting in the formation of sample aerosols of different nature, can occur depending on the characteristics of laser irradiance. The paper covers works on the study of the effect of the laser wavelength, pulse duration, pulse fluence, plasma screening, explosive boiling, and the crater geometry on elemental fractionation and works in which fractionation coefficients were calculated on the basis of experimental data."

The effect of the composition of analytes, which were animal ingredients, on the results is discussed. It is shown that the greatest difficulty is the determination of unsaturated fatty acids present in test samples of different aetiologies in amounts not exceeding 0.05–0.1%."

A method is proposed for the determination of their values using the approximation of the experimental dependence of the relative standard deviation on the analyte concentration by a power function. The choice of the values of the relative standard deviation, being criteria for the estimation of these limits, is substantiated. A concept of the limits of detection and determination of an analytical procedure is formulated, according to which the limit of detection of an analytical procedure is an objective value depending only on the precision of determinations, and the limit of determination of an analytical procedure is a subjective value depending not only on the precision of determinations but also on the requirements to their limiting (admissible) accuracy. The limits of detection and determinations of an analytical procedure found by this approach completely characterize the possibilities of an analytical procedure in determining low concentrations of analytes. The proposed approach can be used for the estimation of the limits of detection and determination of analytical procedures and in other methods of chemical analysis with the hyperbolic dependence of the relative standard deviation on the analyte concentration."

The dependence of mass-spectrometric responses [(M + H)+ ions] on the concentrations of these compounds in water in a range from 10–8 to 10–3 M appears as a curve with a maximum; this is explained by the consideration of the most probable mechanisms of the ionization of drops on liquid spraying in a Collison nebulizer (a model of the destruction of a double electrical layer and a model of statistical fluctuations, which is also known as a model of symmetrical charging). The transformation of the mass spectrum of a mixture (1: 1: 1: 1) of morphine, codeine, papaverine, and heroin was studied on varying the concentration of this mixture in aqueous solution.

In both methods, analyzing a mixture of As(III) and As(V), analysts first record an SVA signal of As(III) in a supporting Na2SO3 electrolyte. To record an analytical SVA signal of As(V), in the first method one should use the reduction of As(V) to As(III) on the surface of an Au-MEA catalyzed by the system Mn(II)/Mn(0) and followed by the formation of As(0) and its anode dissolution. In the second method, the photoreduction of As(V) to As(III) in a Na2SO3 solution is conducted under UV irradiation followed by the reduction of As(III) to As(0) and its electrooxidation on Au-MEA. The two methods are compared taking into account their performance characteristics and interfering ions. To improve the reliability of the results of analysis at an insignificant increase in its cost, we propose the consecutive use of both methods. The procedures are simple and rapid, do not require the removal of dissolved oxygen or toxic reactants, and can be used for the analysis of aqueous solutions at the place of sampling. The results of analyses of real objects, snow, river water, and process solutions are presented."

The effects of isobaric and polyatomic interferences in the spectrum of germanium isotopes have been discussed. It has been shown that the signal intensities of iGeH+ ions formed in the inductively coupled plasma are 0.00001–0.0001 of the intensity of the iGe+ signal. This can result in the overestimation of the found concentration of an isotope with a higher mass number next to the main isotope in recording spectra in the low and medium resolution mode. Approaches ensuring the determination of the isotope composition of highly-enriched monogermanes with the range of isotope concentrations extending five orders of magnitude have been proposed."

Therefore, a new simple and rapid method was proposed to detect MTB by the impedance properties of MTB suspensions using interdigitated microelectrodes. As a result, MTB suspensions in deionized (DI) water with different cell concentrations generated different electrical impedance spectral responses. Whereas MTB suspensions in 0.9 wt. % NaCl solution did not produce any significant differences in the impedance spectra in response to different cell concentrations. In DI water suspensions, the impedance at 1 kHz decreased with increasing cell concentrations. The impedance of MTB suspension in DI water has been discussed; it was found to be resulted from the cell wall charges and release of ions from the cells. There was a linear relationship between the impedance and logarithmic value of the cell concentration in the cell concentration range of 102 to 108 cfu/mL, which can be expressed by the regression equation of Z (kΩ) =–456lnN (cfu/mL) + 9717 with R
2 = 0.99. Detection limit was calculated as 104 cfu/mL, which is comparable with many label-free immunosensors for detecting pathogenic bacteria reported in the literature. This work demonstrated that MTB concentration can be determined through measuring the impedance of MTB suspensions in DI water. This new detection mechanism can be an alternative for current impedance methods available for detecting bacterial cells."

Among chromatography methods, the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) must be considered for using in routine laboratories due to a number of advantages such as practicality, fast results and effectiveness, low cost, and simultaneous determination of analytes. This review describes the application of this technique to foods of animal origin, as well as compares TLC with other chromatographic methods. TLC has a strong potential as a surrogate chromatographic model for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Therefore, several modifications have been carried out to the conventional TLC system. Nevertheless, further studies should be performed in order to contribute with the scientific community and propagate the TLC method, which has performance and economic advantages compared to other chromatographic techniques."

Hybrid materials based on perfluorinated sulfo cation-exchange membranes Nafion and MF-4SC with incorporated zirconium dioxide and silicon dioxide nanoparticles, including those with modified surfaces containing proton-acceptor groups, were used in the PD-sensors. The sensitivity of the PD-sensors to hydronium ions, which interfere with the determination of amino acids at pH < 7, was considerably decreased due to the use of the membranes obtained by an in situ method that contained silicon dioxide nanoparticles with amine-containing groups. The greatest sensitivity of the PD-sensors to the anions of amino acids at pH > 7 and the smallest sensitivity to the cations K+ were observed in hybrid membranes, which combined an increased rate of anion transfer and a low moisture capacity. The use of the PD-sensors based on hybrid membranes makes it possible to determine the cations, anions, and zwitterions of amino acids over a wide range of pH with a sufficiently high accuracy."

For elements with small atomic numbers, the direct ionization of atoms, the major process for the majority of elements of the Periodic Table, is the main only at low energies of primary photons. With the growth of photon energy, the intensity of fluorescence due to photo and Auger electrons arising in the irradiated material increases. This component at certain energy becomes predominant. The further increase in the energy of primary photons leads to the suppression of the ionization of atoms by recoil electron arising in the incoherent (Compton) scattering of primary radiation. The effects of the energy of primary photons on the intensity of X-ray fluorescence for the studied processes differ significantly. The depth of these effects determines their contributions to the formation of the analytical signal.

One of the main objectives of proteomics is characterization of the proteins in biological samples using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the corresponding proteolytic peptide mixtures. Both the complexity and the scale of experimental data obtained even from a single experimental run require specialized bioinformatic tools for automated data mining. One of the most important tools is a so-called proteomics search engine used for identification of proteins present in a sample by comparing experimental and theoretical tandem mass spectra. The latter are generated for the proteolytic peptides derived from a protein database. Peptide identifications obtained with the search engine are then scored according to the probability of a correct peptide-spectrum match. The purpose of this work was to perform a comparison of different search algorithms using data acquired for complex protein mixtures, including both annotated protein standards and clinical samples. The comparison was performed for three popular search engines: commercially available Mascot, as well as open-source X!Tandem and OMSSA. It was shown that the search engine OMSSA identifies in general a smaller number of proteins, while X!Tandem and Mascot deliver similar performance. We found no compelling reasons for using the commercial search engine instead of its open source competitor."

Using this model it is possible to simulate ion motion in gas under influence of electric fields in wide ion velocity range. Collision cross sections of the ions were calculated from the experimentally measured drift times. Calculated cross sections for most of the ions showed significant dependence on the ion drift velocity.

The “flexibility” of such preconcentration systems is demonstrated: impregnated and adsorption-modified adsorbents can be obtained, elements can be extracted as pre-synthesized synthesized hydrophobic complexes, and the desorption of elements can be performed with the destruction of such complexes or without it. It is shown that the large number of similar preconcentration systems enable the creation of effective configurations of hybrid and combined systems for analyzing various samples."

In one of them it is believed that the limits of detection and determination fundamentally correlate with each other and the limit of determination can be found via the limit detection by multiplying the latter by different coefficients, the choice of which is in some cases insufficiently well substantiated. In this work, a correlation between the limits of determination and detection is studied based on experimental data of the X-ray fluorescence analysis of mineral substances for the major and trace components. We found no functional dependence between the studied values; therefore, the results obtained in the above approach to estimation of the limit of determination are ambiguous."

The bioreceptors are polyelectrolyte microcapsules (size of 3–4 μm) with encapsulated paramagnetic particles of Fe3O4 and enzyme urease, capable of biotransforming urea. The bioreceptor was formed on the surface of a transistor gate using a constant magnetic field; the sedimentation of microcapsules in the gate zone proceeded because of the presence of paramagnetic particles in the bioreceptor. The microcapsules were prepared separately and stored at 4°C. This method of biosensor formation took several seconds and did not require additional chemical reagents for treating the electrode surface before and after the measurement. The lower limit of the detection of urea was 0.03 mM in the range of 0.03–100 mM.

MW assisted preparation of FAMEs offers analysts a high-through-put, rapid and universal method to help overcome this potentially costly and labour intensive regulatory hurdle."

The structures of bacterial CFAs were inferred from the interpretation of mass spectra with electron ionization of the corresponding 3-pyridylcarbinol esters. In the method used, the entire bacterial cells are pyrolyzed in the presence of a derivatizing reagent, and CFA isolation prior to the GC-MS analysis is not required. The method is argued to be a cheap, fast and accurate alternative to classical esterification to 3-pyridylcarbinol esters, while still providing more detailed results than methods based on esterification to methyl esters. Significat reduction in required minimum bacterial mass allows for fast identification of the microorganisms, in particular slow growing bacteria species."

THC amounts extracted in the PLE process using nhexane or methanol are very similar. THCA amounts extracted in the PLE process using n-hexane are generally greater than those extracted in the Soxhlet apparatus but smaller when methanol is applied in the PLE process. The obtained results evidently show that the mutual transformations of THCA, THC and CBN occur not only during Soxhlet extraction but also during short-lasting PLE. In the last case, however, they are small. The intensity of the transformation depends on the applied extractant type."

The procedure is based on a redox reaction occurring between the SSES and potassium iodate in an acidic medium. Formed in stoichiometric quantity iodine oxidizes leucocrystal violet to the crystal violet dye, whose coloring is a base of the spectrophotometric measurements. The crystal violet dye formed shows maximum and stable absorbance at pH = 4.1 ± 0.1 and λ = 590 nm. The molar absorptivity, limit of detection and limit of determination of the method were calculated to be 6.98 × 104 L/mol cm, 0.10 and 0.13 μg/mL, respectively. The color system obeys Beer’s law in the range 0.2–2.0 μg/mL of SSES. The optimum analytical conditions were evaluated. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of SSES in pharmaceutical preparations, without the need of any complicated instrumentation. Reliability of determination was confirmed applying standard iodometric method, recommended by European and Polish Pharmacopoeia."

A comparative study of particle size distribution in HA samples is performed using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DS), and static light scattering (SS). The effect of heat treatment on the morphology of the synthesized products is evaluated. It is found that the effect of ultrasound (US) on the dispersity of HA particles in aqueous suspensions depends on the nature of the precursor and heat treatment. It is shown that the HA particles synthesized from calcium hydroxide (HA-OH) aggregate more rapidly than the particles synthesized from calcium nitrate (HA-NO

). After the ultrasonic treatment of suspensions, the relative concentration of large HA-NO3 submicroparticles increased, while particle size distribution in the suspension of HA-OH remained virtually the same. The heat treatment of HA powders at 900°C reduced the ability of particles to aggregate. It is found by CZE that, with increasing time of ultrasonication of suspensions, the relative concentration of nanoscaled and similar in size HA-NO3 submicroparticles increased markedly, while it changed only slightly in the HA-OH suspension. The reasons for the differences are discussed. A procedure for determining the concentration of HA submicroparticles in suspension by CZE is proposed. A linear dependence of normalized peak areas on HA concentration in suspension is obtained."

This method is based on gold nanoparticles multi-functionalized by 17E-17DS duplex and barcode DNA, AuNPs@(17E-17DS duplex & barcode DNA). The complex of 17E and 17DS (duplex) was constructed by the hybridization between 17E DNAzyme and its corresponding 17DS cleavage substrate. Because 17E DNAzyme has high specificity for lead(II), the presence of lead(II) induces 17E DNAzyme to specifically cleave 17DS. A barcode DNA complementary to the capture DNA was employed to reduce the amount of 17E-17DS duplex used and increase the capture probability of cleaved AuNPs@(17E-17DS duplex & barcode DNA) conjugates, and thus effectively improve the detection sensitivity. The test results for lead(II) could be visually obtained within 10 min without any instrument and sample pretreatment, with a detection limit 20 nM. In addition, the selectivity of this sensing system was investigated by challenging the sensor with other divalent metal ions, and no significant interference was found.

This enhanced design includes an ion funnel inter-face at the input orifice of the DMA and a nozzle beam stage at the output of the DMA. These improvements allow the detection of fluorescence not only from pure dyes and their clusters, as was demonstrated recently, but also from fluorophore-tagged biomolecules. Complex mixtures of fluorescent compounds can be separated by the DMA and studied by LIF. This unique combination of instruments also provides a powerful platform for probing fluorescent proteins in the gas phase. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) was tested on a new setup. In contrast to high vacuum, where no GFP fluorescence was detected, the presence of a LIF signal at the output of the DMA could explain some specific fluorescent properties of GFP in the gas phase. Given that both conformation and fluorescence are key properties of biological molecules in the gas phase, we expect that our enhanced design will answer the question whether gas-phase proteins retain their liquid-phase native structure or not."
Study of electrospray ion mobility dependence on the ion bunch drift velocity in the radio frequency quadrupole,"December 2014, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/69-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934814130048,Articles,12 December 2014,"The objective of this work is the study of the ion mobility dependence of electrospray Gramicidin S ions [M + 2H]2+ on the ion bunch drift velocity under variation of the specific electrical field strength at certain gas number density in the range from 0 to 300 Td. The ion mobility measurements were carried out under rotational excitation of ions using custom built gas filled segmented radio frequency quadrupole with the nitrogen buffer gas pressure of 1.9 Pa. The resulting ion mobility dependence of [M + 2H]2+ Gramicidin S ions upon the bunch drift velocity is essentially weaker, than it could be expected from the hard sphere collision model. By comparing the acquired ion mobility dependencies with the theoretical ones derived from the hard sphere collision model we suppose that the attractive polarization potential takes an essential part into the ion-molecular interaction even for such big organic ions as Gramicidin S."
Comparative analysis of interactions of some lariat crown ethers and their unsubstituted analogues with alkali metal salts in the gas phase by MALDI mass spectrometry,"December 2014, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/69-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934814130103,Articles,12 December 2014,"In this work, interactions of some crown ethers, including lariat ethers bearing a side-arm methoxyphenoxymethyl substituent, with alkali metal salts were studied by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Peaks of cationized molecules [M + Cat]+, sandwich complexes [2M + Cat]+, [3M + Cat]+ ions, and cluster ions [2M + 2Cat + An]+ and [2M + 3Cat + 2An]+ were observed in the mass spectra; herein M is a crown ether molecule, Cat is an alkali metal cation, and An is a monobasic acid anion. The results were compared with previously obtained data for 15-crown-5, [ortho]- and [para]-methoxyphenoxymethyl-15-crown-5 ether mixtures with sodium salts. The conclusions made before, that an increase in the shielding degree of the cation in complexes with lariat ethers led to a significant decrease in the peak intensity of cluster ions [2M + 2Cat + An]+, were confirmed. For potential lariat ethers the absence or only trace amounts of such cluster ions along with the presence of an intense cluster ion peak in the mass spectrum for an unsubstituted analogue can serve a test for the involvement of the lateral fragment of the crown ether in complex formation, i.e., the lariat effect."

The main interference for gallium isotopes 69Ga and 71Ga was found, associated with overlaps generated by elements as such Ba, Mn, Ce, and Nd, whose concentrations in ferromanganese crusts can be quite high. The potentials of a quadrupole ICP-MS spectrometer with a collision cell for suppressing spectral noise and a high-resolution ICP-MS spectrometer for the determination of gallium are compared. It is found that in the case of the quadrupole mass spectrometer in the mode both with collision cell and without it, the use of isotope 69Ga is extremely difficult because of overlapping with the doubly-charged ion 138Ba2+. In the case of isotope 71Ga, the arising polyatomic interferences, for example, from 55Mn16O+, are successfully eliminated using a collision cell filled with helium; however, this enhances overlaps with 142Ce2+ and 142Nd2+. High-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry enables the determination of gallium by both its isotopes; the above interferences are eliminated."

The formation of 20- to 25-nm thick oxynitride coatings in the contacting region of the blades was observed. It was found that this coating was of the diffusive nature and produced via the plasma nitriding of the contacts.

The analysis of mass spectra of several peptides and proteins produced by electrospray ionization carried out on this basis made possible some conclusions about their ion structure and behavior inside the ion source. A generalization of the method for the case of multidimensional charge state distributions corresponding to the retention of various charge carriers by ions of biomolecules is described. Hopefully, this will make possible gaining more substantial information concerning the structure and behavior of biomolecule ions in solutions and under electrospray conditions, which can be important for various biological applications."

Testing a new method has shown its higher accuracy and, for a special case of a single type of charge carriers in comparison to the previously implemented method mainly at the expense of the implementation of new methods for averaging the results obtained. A number of calculations for experimental mass spectra of polyprotonated Cytochrome C molecules was made. The results apparently indicate changes in their both native and denaturated structures at different compositions of solution."

The latter can significantly improve the effectiveness of conveying of charged particles by the radio frequency ion traps with ring electrodes used as the ion guides and ion storage devices."

The present work is focused on the mercury desorption use for soil, sediments and tailings study. The extensive experimental material of many authors was summarized in this work with regard to a critical confrontation of approaches used in data interpretation. The main emphasis was put on the most frequently observed forms as Hg0, Hg2+ bound to mineral or organic surfaces, Hg2+ bound to the most common ligands and HgS. A comprehensive conception of the usage possibilities of this method as suitable analytical tool for speciation analysis was the main aim. This work includes not only the preparation of calibration materials and the description of their desorption behaviour but also summarizes the interpretations of mercury release curves of real samples and becomes an effective tool for their evaluation."
Inertness criterion for gas-chromatographic systems,"December 2014, issue 12",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/69-12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934814120156,Articles,23 November 2014,"For evaluating the inertness of gas-chromatographic systems with respect to the polar components of test samples as the most important parameter of these samples, it was proposed to decrease the number of test mixture components to two but to perform the analysis of their solutions of different concentrations in contrast to previously known recommendations. Statistically significant differences in the relative chromatographic peak areas of polar and nonpolar components are a criterion for insufficient inertness. The analyte amount (expressed as the mass index pm = −log m) in the sample of a mixed solution with an inert component (n-alkane) at which differences in the relative peak areas become higher than the sums of the standard deviations of the relative areas, as compared with more concentrated solutions at the same ratios between the components, can be considered the inertness limit of a chromatographic system with respect to the characterized compound."
Ionic liquid for homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction separation/preconcentration and determination of cobalt in saline samples,"December 2014, issue 12",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/69-12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934814120090,Articles,23 November 2014,"A novel homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction technique based on use of ionic liquids (ILs), termed in situ solvent formation microextraction (ISFME) is developed for separation/preconcentration of Co(II) ions. In this method, small amount of sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6, as an ion-pairing agent) was added to the sample solution containing very small amount of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Hmim][BF4], as hydrophilic IL). A cloudy solution was formed as a result of formation of fine droplets of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [Hmim][PF6]. After centrifuging, the fine droplets of the extractant phase settled to the bottom of the conical-bottom glass centrifuge tube. ISFME is a simple and rapid method for extraction and preconcentration of cobalt ions from water samples that can be applied for the sample solutions containing very high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, this technique is much safer in comparison with the organic solvent extraction. Reliability of the introduced methodology was evaluated by analyzing water reference material. ISFME was successfully applied to determining cobalt(II) in real water samples. Schiff base ligand, 3,3′-(1E,1E′)-(propane-1,2-diylbis(azan-1-yl-1-ylidene)bis(methan-1-yl-1-ylidene)bis(4-bromophenol) (L) was chosen as a complexing agent. Analysis was carried out using atomic absorption spectrometry. Type and amount of IL, pH and the other parameters were optimized.

For aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, the retention times grow exponentially with the number of carbon atoms in the analyte. The retention times decrease exponentially with increasing separation temperature. The dependences of the reduced mobilities of two peaks in the ionograms of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols with drift in air at 330 K on the number of carbon atoms in the analyte molecules with a saturated nonbranched chain are obtained. In the range of molecular weights studied, normalized mobilities linearly decrease with increasing number of carbon atoms in the analyte, which is consistent with the published data. For substances with equal numbers of carbon atoms and a nonbranched chain, mobility decreases in the order ketone > aldehyde > alcohol."

It was found that the peak at 0.44 V is integral in nature; gallic acid contributes to this peak. The peak at 0.59 V is a result of the oxidation of ellagic acid. We developed a method for the evaluation of the antioxidant capacity (AOC) of cognacs and brandies by differential pulse voltammetry and tested it on nine samples. The total area of two oxidation steps was selected as a parameter characterizing the antioxidant properties. Antioxidant capacity was expressed in equivalents of ellagic acid per 100 mL of a beverage. Correlations between the AOC of beverages and their total AOC and ferric reducing power (r = 0.9752 and 0.9539 at P = 0.95, respectively) are found."

A new sensitive method for the determination of trace mercury by differential pulse polarography: Application to raw salt sample,"November 2014, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/69-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934814110112,Articles,21 October 2014,"A new indirect differential pulse polarographic (DPP) method is established for the trace determination of mercury(II). Because of its toxic effects on human health, trace determination of mercury is very important. An indirect method had to be used since no polarographic peak is observed in its direct determination. According to the standard potentials, the reaction between Sn(II) and Hg(II) was found suitable. The peak of Sn(II) at about −0.40 V is sharp, high and very reproducible, which enables the determination of low concentrations of Hg(II). For this purpose, to a known amount of Sn(II) present in the polarographic cell (acetic acid, HAc, pH 1–2), the unknown Hg(II) sample is added and the quantitative reaction takes place directly in the cell. The Hg(II) concentration is calculated simply from the decrease of the Sn(II) peak. The limit of detection (LOD) was found as 2 × 10−7 M for S/N = 3. Interferences of some common cations, such as Fe, Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb and anions have been investigated. Only Pb had an overlapping peak with Sn(II). This peak overlap was eliminated simply by working at pH 2 (HAc electrolyte), because of the shift of the Pb peak in the Ac complex to −0.7 V. This method was successfully applied to synthetic samples and raw salt sample taken from a salt lake in Turkey."
Characteristic variations of gas-chromatographic retention indices for phases of variable composition,"November 2014, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/69-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934814110148,Articles,21 October 2014,"On an example of mixtures of dinonyl phthalate and 2,2′-bis-(2-cyanoethoxy)diethyl ether, it was shown that the dependence of gas-chromatographic retention indices (RIs) on the composition (α) of mixed stationary phases can be both linear and with various abnormalities. These features of the dependence of RI-α can be explained by the existence of areas of homogeneity and disintegration of mixed phases. Another reason for the nonlinearity of the dependence RI-α is that the components of phases of variable composition are expressed in mole fractions, which is typical for polymethylphenylsiloxanes, widely used in contemporary gas chromatography. It is shown that the expression of composition in mass fractions enables the approximation of these dependencies in the homogeneity regions by linear regression equations with sufficient accuracy."

The main goal of these investigations is to find some relationship between the GC-MS signal (peak area) and the test molecule chemical structure. By means of the knowledge of correlations of relative molar response, the quantitative analysis passes into easier and fewer reference materials are needed to investigate a sample having lot of component, because the sensitivities can be determined from the correlations studied in this paper. This is very important in daily analytical tasks, particularly for impurity profiling studies. Relative responses of some polychlorinated benzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls and n-alkylbenzenes are compared in the experiments. Linear correlation is found between the molecular structures of n-alkylbenzenes, i.e. the carbon atom number, and relative molar response. Relative molar responses of polychlorinated biphenyls also provided linear correlation taken as a function of chlorine atom number. Under given conditions, the increments of CH2 unit and chlorine atom number to the relative molar responses are 0.221 and 0.198, respectively. However, relative responses of polychlorinated benzenes showed diversity plotted against chlorine atom number, and their isomer compounds also gave various results according to the first ionization energy. The measurement conditions can influence the relative responses. The low injector temperature, the interface and the ion source temperature affected relative responses of high volatile compounds. However, when the parameters are kept under control, the results can become accurate and reproducible."

The total area of the oxidation steps was selected as a parameter characterizing the antioxidant properties. The AOC of spices was expressed as a weight of gallic acid in milligrams per 1 g of a dry spice. Seventeen different spices were tested. The AOC decreases in the series of clove > juniper berries > nutmeg > cinnamon > rosemary > anise ≥ oregano > black pepper ≥ ginger ≥ basil > turmeric > red pepper ≈ bay leaf ≥ coriander ≈ red sweet pepper > cumin > caraway. A correlation between the AOC obtained by voltammetry and the total AOC, ferric reducing power, antiradical activity, and total content of phenolic compounds and these parameters with each other is found; the correlation coefficients vary in the range 0.8886–0.9615."

The metrological parameters of ICP MS analysis (accuracy, precision, and detection limits) were calculated. It was established that, in the analysis of test sample solutions with tantalum concentrations higher than 30 mg/L, a matrix effect appeared: the intensity of the measured ion current of analytes decreased against the background of a high concentration of sample matrix (tantalum) ions. This caused a proportional underestimation of the results of analysis. It was shown that it is reasonable to plot calibration functions against the background of a solution containing no more than 30 mg/L of tantalum ions. The results of the ICP MS analysis were compared with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and optical emission spectrometry (OES) analysis data and calculation data on the amounts of admixtures introduced into tantalum pentoxide at the stage of the extraction preparation of a precursor."

Factors such as micelle concentration, pH, concentration of buffer, etc. were investigated in order to obtain the optimum conditions for the separation. The optimized separation procedure employed 25 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer containing 70 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at pH 8.7 as background electrolyte, 25°C of capillary temperature and 20 kV of separation voltage. UV detection was at 260 nm and injection was hydrodynamic at 50 mbar for 3 s. The whole analysis was completed within 13 min. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the peak areas for method precision ranged from 1.4 to 7.6%, and the recovery was between 80.2 and 112.9%. The limit of detection (LOD) for 15 nucleosides and nuleobases was between 0.25 and 0.75 μg/mL. According to the evaluation study, the method was shown to be precise, accurate and reproducible. The proposed MECC method was successfully applied for determination of nucleosides and nucleobases in Chinese Anthopleura lanthogrammica Berkly.

All experimental and voltammetric conditions were previously optimized to obtain the best analytical signal in terms of intensities and profile of the reduction peaks. For NIM, the peak currents were related to the one-electron reduction of a nitro group to a stable radical anion, which is followed by a one-electron transfer and a protonation step with a consequent formation of a nitrosoanion. The voltammetric results indicated that the mechanism of OFX involved the transfer of two electrons and two protons in a totally irreversible reduction related to the conversion of a ketone group to an alcohol group. Analytical parameters such as linearity range, equations of the analytical curves, correlation coefficients, detection and quantification limits, recovery efficiency, and relative standard deviation for repeatability and reproducibility experiments were compared to similar results obtained by the use of UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and the results showed that the voltammetric procedure using HMDE is suitable to determine pharmaceutical compounds in complex samples.

Adsorbent type stationary phases provided better retention and separation for the exceedingly volatile components than polar/non-polar liquid phases. The tested silica-based porous-layer phase was found to be susceptible to degradation through interaction with acid fluoride species. The analysis was ultimately performed in two stages. Authentic oxidation product gas samples were first analyzed, then treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide to remove carbonyl compounds and resampled to determine oxygen content on the same system. Detector response factor ratios for a number of different perfluorocarbons were obtained, the information which is useful for chromatographic method development but is conspicuously absent in the open literature.

MALDI spectra were rather simple and contained the peaks for [Cat]+ · ions that are structurally identical to radical cations formed during the reduction of the salts in solution. Among all the methods, DART and MALDI are suitable for the qualitative analysis of such bis-quaternary salts, while ESI is convenient for the quantitative analysis of these analytes."

The specific representation of mass spectra of a complex mixture as a table of 14 homological series allows the analyst to visualize characteristic ion clusters specific for the compound types. These ion clusters form a “type mass spectrum” for each compound type. In the mass chromatograms of ions of a homologous ion series, these ion clusters form peculiar three-dimensional chromatographic peaks, whose width along the retention time axis corresponds to the isomer distribution for the homologue, molecular mass distribution (if molecular ions are considered), or structural features of the system of fused rings (for fragment ions) and “volume,” the concentration of the compound type. Three-dimensional chromatographic peaks for compound types are similar to usual peaks for individual compounds in ion mass chromatograms."

Tobacco plants of the Samsun variety were grown in a closed gas-nutrient system on a mineral medium with sucrose as a carbon source. Naphthalene used as a toxicant at a concentration of 5.2 × 10−4% contained 13C isotope whose amount was characterized by the value δ13C = +281.4 ± 0.6‰ relative to the PDB standard and differed from that of sucrose, the main source of carbon (δ13C = −12.0 ± 0.1‰). Degradation of naphthalene was determined by the inclusion of its carbon in metabolic CO2 and plant tissues (the root, stem, leaves). The effect of naphthalene on plants was indicated by the rates of O2 production and CO2 uptake during the light period as compared with the dark period of exposure. A decrease of the toxic effect of naphthalene on plants was observed only at the inoculation of plants with Pseudomonas aureofaciens BS1393 rhizosphere bacteria bearing plasmid pBS216, which controls the naphthalene biodegradation ability. The occurrence of other heterotrophic microorganisms incapable of naphthalene degradation had no similar protective effect."

It has been shown that the variations of δ13C values in plant tissues and berries are related to the climatic conditions of plant growth: moisture (a sum of annual precipitation) and temperature (a sum of annual effective temperatures). The carbon isotope ratios of vegetative and generative parts of vine plants have been found to be noticeably affected by vine varieties. The different 13C contents in ethanol produced from wine of the Aligoté and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties grown in two Russian vineyard regions are due to vine growth conditions, variety attribution and wine production techniques. An analytically significant parameter determined as exemplified by the Aligoté and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties in fermentation of vine harvested in different seasons and in both vineyard regions was an increased 13C content in ethanol with respect to dry (non-volatile) residue in wine after distillation of ethanol. This characteristic has been determined by a systematic difference of about 1–2‰ between the δ13C value of ethanol and the dry residue. A relative constancy in the carbon isotope composition of ethanol and of the dry residue in the final product is the basis for determining the authenticity of grape wines by means of isotopic mass spectrometry irrespective of natural factors."

A method for distinguishing ions and droplets inside a gas dynamic interface is utilized and supported by computational simulation. The droplets are shown to dominate in the current by ESI for all the capillaries studied. It is shown experimentally that space charge effects predominated over diffusion ones for all practically important currents and capillaries. The estimations show that electrostatic repulsion and their attraction to capillary walls because of the mirror charge induced by all particles are close in effect."

0), which is applicable to any temperature conditions of gas-chromatographic analysis, is proposed. The procedure is based on the extrapolation of the absolute retention times of homologs (n-alkanes) with the estimation of the retention time of a hypothetical homolog with the zero number of carbon atoms in the molecule using recurrence relations. A consequence of this approximation is the modification of a known formula for the estimation of t
0 from the retention times of three sequential homologs (the Peterson and Hirsch method), which consists in the replacement of absolute retention times by their squares. This modification makes this method applicable to not only isothermal conditions but also temperature programming conditions."

The stability of the major metabolites, biomarkers of neurode-generative diseases, was examined depending on the procedure of sample pretreatment. As shown, the optimal conditions of the sample pretreatment of brain tissues to NMR analysis involve mechanical homogenization followed by the addition of deuterated water and for prolong experiments, an extraction with a methanol-chloroform mixture (2: 1). Samples of cerebrospinal fluid for NMR study should be prepared in buffer media based on deuterated water to improve the stability of the preparation and prevent the drift of metabolite signals in the spectra of different samples during the experimentation.

By selecting cutoff thresholds, pulses were discriminated from the radiation superimposing on the analytical signal in the highest orders of reflection. The interfering lines are Y Lγ2,3, Th Mζ1, and Th Mζ2. High-aperture and standard spectrometers of the microanalyser do not ensure the complete resolution of Th radiation with the Pb Mα line, and its software allows the analyst to take into account the superposition of only one element. The contribution of interfering radiation is insignificant: the presence of 1% Y2O3 or ThO2 results in the overestimation of PbO by ∼0.009 and 0.002%, respectively. The nearest free regions for measuring background are at ±4.5 mm from the Pb Mα line. Using the background measured in the short-wave region systematically underestimates the amount of PbO by 0.098 wt %. Measurements on the other side lead to overestimation by 0.061%. Calculations of the average background value are more preferable and underestimate the results by approximately 0.019%. To decrease the error more, one should record a spectrum for the determination of its bremsstrahlung component under the lead line."

Optimum extraction conditions were found to be 32°C, 2 mL/g for the ratio of the volume of the Schiff base solution to the amount of oil, and 11 min for the stirring time. The method has been validated by using oil based metal standard, obtaining satisfactory results. The limit of detection (LOD) of the improved method is 0.04 μg/g. It has been applied to analysis of different oil samples. The concentrations of iron in olive, sunflower and corn oils were found to be 0.65 ± 0.02, 0.41 ± 0.01, 0.36 ± 0.03 μg/g, respectively. A simple, cheap, rapid, efficient, sensitive and accurate alternative analytical method for the iron determination in oils has been presented in this paper."

Because of the continuity of most kinds of spectral responses, the adaptive wavelength interval selection by modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) could be proposed in the present study. The proposed method was used for simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of caffeine, aspirin, and phenacetin and simultaneous differential pulse voltammetric determination of nitrophenol isomers. The method was eventually applied to commercial drugs. For comparison, a conventional full-spectrum PSO analysis was also performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive wavelength interval selection by modified PSO is capable of improving the future predictive ability of the model."

The method was based upon the highly sensitive color reaction of mercury(II) ions with 2,4-bis(4-phenylazophenylaminodiazo)benzenesulfonic acid (BPPABSA). We found that in the presence of 2.0% Triton X-100, the reagent reacts with mercury to form a stable red complex in a borax buffer solution at pH 10.22. The formed complex shows an absorption maximum at 530 nm. The apparent molar absorptivity is 2.18 × 105 L/mol cm. The content of mercury in the sample was low and some foreign ions might interfere with the determination of mercury(II), so we used sulfhydryl dextran gel (SDG) to separate and enrich trace mercury(II), which lead to a satisfactory result. Under the optimal conditions, Beer’s law is obeyed in the range of 0–15 μg/25 mL Hg2+, the detection limit and relative standard deviation are 0.86 ng/mL and 1.4–3.8%, respectively.

Despite its benefits over univariate approach, chemometrics has been rarely exploited for optimizing SIA methods. Moreover, in those methods, some conditions have not been considered in optimization process. In the current study, more conditions, namely volumes and concentrations of reagents, have been optimized by chemometrics for the first time. A developing oxidation reaction of chlorpromazine by permanganate in acidic media was adopted. A spectrophotometric detection of the reduction of permanganate was applied at 526 nm using miniaturized fiber optic devices. The 24 full-factorial design and response surface approaches were exploited for method optimization. The method was validated and realized by a British Pharmacopoeia method. Experimental conditions and analytical aspects of the current SIA method were compared with those of a previous SIA method. Some analytical aspects were comparable while other aspects demonstrated better results from the current method than those from the previous one. The current method is rapid with a sample frequency of 51.4 samples/h. It is also reagent-saving with a total volume of consumed reagents and sample of 260 μL as well as environmental-safety with a total volume of waste production of 1260 μL. The method is therefore efficient for industrial-scale pharmaceutical analysis."

Measurement of an analytical signal or measurement of the content of an analyte?,"March 2013, issue 3",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/68-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934813030052,Letters to the Editor,07 March 2013,"The paper raises the question about the place of measurement in chemical analysis: whether a measurement is concentrated, as often believed, at the step of analysis where an analytical signal is produced or quantitative analysis as a whole is an indirect measurement of the content of an analyte. Detailed background information on the subject is presented with some examples from well-known textbooks on analytical chemistry, in which the step of “measurement” of an analytical process is treated as a measurement of the analyte (content). Such understanding agrees with the relevant metrological concepts presented in the IUPAC Compendium of Analytical Nomenclature. A characteristic feature of any measurement is a comparison with a unit of quantity to be measured. This is done at the final step of analysis, when the analytical signal obtained for a given analyte is compared with a signal corresponding to the unit of analyte content. The determination of the analytical signals in units of a corresponding physical quantity is often unnecessary in chemical analysis. For this and other reasons one can speak about the measurement of a signal only with a certain degree of conventionality."

Usually the determination is preceded by a separation step. In order to find out a selective and quantitative isolation method, coprecipitation with thioacetamide and Cu(II) as a carrier; MnO2; cupferron, tannin and crystal violet; quinolin-8-ol, tannin and thioacetamide, were examined. Molybdenum(VI) could be determined in the presence of 100-fold mass excess of tungsten after precipitation with thioacetamide and Cu(II). The remaining methods could only be applied if mass excess of W is equal to or lower with respect to Mo. For the resolution of this problem, the derivative spectrophotometry was used. The studies of different order spectra of gallein complexes of molybdenum, tungsten and their mixtures have shown that the fifth-derivative spectra allows one to eliminate the interfering effects of W on the determination of Mo. At 650 nm the spectral features of tungsten is zeroing while the value of the fifth-derivative spectrum of mixture of Mo and W corresponds only to the concentration of molybdenum in the examined solution. Beer’s law is obeyed in the range 0.32–0.80 μg/mL of Mo. The developed derivative spectrophotometric method and the most selective pre-separation method, based on the precipitation of molybdenum(VI) sulphide, were applied to the determination of Mo in Armco iron and steel. The accuracy of the elaborated methods was confirmed by comparison of the determined content of Mo with certified values as well as with the result obtained by the reference ICP-OES technique."

Microtitrimetry by controlled current potentiometric titration,"January 2013, issue 1",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/68-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934813010024,Articles,29 December 2012,"The classical methods of titration require large volumes of chemicals. Microtritimetry is the method of choice since it utilizes small quantities of chemicals and yields less waste compared to other conventional methods. Thus it benefits both the analytical chemists and the environment. In this communication, microtitrimetry is performed by employing the technique of differential electrolytic potentiometry for the location of the end point. Oxidation-reduction titration using platinum electrodes is described. For the first time the endpoint for a sample of 1.0 μL of 0.10 M Fe(II) has been located by titration using a solution of Ce(IV). The optimum conditions such as volume of cerium ammonium sulfate added, current applied to polarize the electrodes in case of dc controlled current potentiometric titration (CCPT). The effect of changing the percentage bias of the square wave used to polarize the electrodes on the differential peak in case of ac CCPT has been investigated. The precision of this microtitrimetric method is also reported."

Intensity of molecular ion peak in electron ionization mass spectra,"December 2012, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/67-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934812140080,Articles,29 November 2012,"Compounds from NIST′08 and Wiley 8th databases were considered as a representative subset of the general population of organic compounds which can be analyzed using mass spectrometry with electron ionization. The percentage of organic compounds as a function of intensity of molecular ion (M+•) peak normalized to the base peak was determined for the first time. It was shown that only 26% compounds have high-intensity M+• peaks (greater than 50% of base peak). Intensity of M+• peak is less than or equal to 1 or 5% of base peak for 24 or 37% compounds respectively. It means that in case of trace-level analysis M+• peak may not be registered for quarter (or even more) of organic compounds. It is well-known that the absence of M+• peaks in electron ionization mass spectra reduces reliability of unknown compound identification based on library search. Therefore determination of molecular mass by independent technique (e.g., mass spectrometry with chemical ionization) is necessary for increasing the identification reliability."
Effect of radio frequency electric fields on ion gas dynamic transport in mass-spectrometers,"December 2012, issue 14",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/67-14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193481214002X,Articles,29 November 2012,"The paper considers the transportation of charged particles in a gas filled medium where the ion motion is controlled by the electrostatic fields, radio frequency (RF) fields and gas dynamic flows. The differential equations describing the dynamics of the continuous medium filled by the ions are considered as the starting point. The dynamics of the medium which is characterized at any point by the ion’s density and the ion’s average velocity, is determined by the ion’s inertia, the applied electric fields and the effective drag force (Stokes’ viscous friction) caused by the collisions of the ions with the gas molecules. The equations describing the averaged ion transportation are derived for a particular case of non-uniform radio frequency electric fields; the said equations are the analogs of the pseudopotentials widely used for the description of the charged particles motion in RF electric fields. The results can be useful for understanding of the principles of controlling the ion flows in gas dynamic interfaces of the mass spectrometers and for rapid qualitative simulation and optimization of gas dynamic interfaces."

The isotope analysis is carried out with mass bias effect correction by a combination of internal normalization to the standard Zr-isotope ratio and bracketing standard method (external normalization). Our results for geochemical IAPSO and BCR-1 standard samples are in a good agreement with the published data. The reproducibility of the 88Sr/86Sr ratio varies from ±0.015 to ±0.05‰ (depending on the sample features) and, together with the analysis accuracy, is superior to the previously reported methods of MC-ICP-MS analysis. Still ahead is only double spike thermal ionization mass spectrometry with its ±0.02‰ reproducibility. However, the new method allows the simultaneous determination of 88Sr/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios and its productivity is higher by 5 to 6 times. On the other hand, in sample preparation, it is necessary to strive for at least 95% Sr yield from the chromatographic column; otherwise the sorption-desorption process may lead to a 0.6‰ 88Sr/86Sr ratio bias relative to the true value."

The introduction of water-soluble donor-active solvents (hexamethylphosphoric triamide, N,N-diethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, and N,N-diethylformamide) leads to a considerable increase in the extraction of the ion associates of platinum and the simultaneous suppression of the extraction of the simple dye salt.

A comparative study of the results of the fractionation of the forms of heavy metals differing in physicochemical mobility and bioavailability (Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr), obtained using a number of procedures of sequential extraction, is performed. Particular attention is paid to mercury, which is quite different from other metals in biogeochemical properties. Conditions are described for the dynamic fractionation of arsenic species occurring in natural samples in anionic forms. It is revealed that, in contrast to batch extraction, the continuous renewal of the eluent in a rotating column eliminates the problem of readsorption and overlapping of isolated fractions and enables the correct assessment of the concentration of the most mobile and bioavailable forms of toxic elements. A hyphenated method for the fractionation and determination of certain forms of elements (based on the ICP-AES detection of elements in the column eluate in the on-line mode) is described, ensuring the processing and a real-time control of the dynamic extraction of the forms of elements. The kinetic aspects of selective leaching are considered. It is shown that a comparison of the elution curves of micro- and macrocomponents makes possible a judgment about the selectivity of the leaching reagent, optimization of the conditions for the isolation of each fraction, and the investigation of the features of the binding of heavy metals and matrix elements in soils and bottom sediments. Some recommendations are given for the dynamic fractionation of the forms of elements in soils, sludges, and bottom sediments in RCCs."

However, an increase in the water percentage up to 50% and beyond leads to a substantial decrease and then the total disappearance of the analytical signal. A scheme of electrode reaction responsible for the signal formation is proposed. The effect of surfactants on the oxidation of α-tocopherol in aqueous acetonitrile is estimated. As found, surfactants (N-dodecylpyridinium bromide, Triton X-100 and N-cetylpyridinium bromide) enhance the current of α-tocopherol oxidation.

Since the properties of various types of lanthanides are very similar, the separation of lanthanides using the usual approaches was not possible. Thus, the separation of lanthanides was devised upon partial, competing complexation in order to differentiate their properties. Salicylic acid was firstly used as the primary UV-absorbing ligand, whereas formic, acetic, lactic, tartaric and citric acids, which showed no absorption in UV-spectrum and had weaker complexes in comparison to salicylic acid, were used as auxiliary ligands. Upon the results of spectrometry, the wave length of 210 nm was selected for detecting lanthanides. The properties and stability of lanthanides were examined and furthermore acetic and citric acids were selected as auxiliary ligands. The simulation was carried out with respect to the transport phenomena in the unsteady state. The ion species dissociation was found to be directly dependent upon the concentration, and was also used in complexation. The results of simulation showed that the diffusion control of H+ and homogenizing electrical field promoted separation quality. The separation conditions were optimized by using the simulation results as well as the tests obtained. In order to optimize the experimental conditions, variable factors such as voltage, injection time, pH, temperature and ionic strength were examined. Also, methanol was used as dissolving modifier as well as noise reducer on the base line.

The integration of mass spectra in a wide energy range intended for obtaining satisfactory results of analysis leads to a 3–5-fold reduction of the resolving capacity. In the case of the LAMAS-10 device, the resolution for W = 50–300 eV energy dispersion of the ions varies from R ∼ 1000 (for W = 300 eV) to R ∼ 150 (for W = 50 eV), such values being insufficient for quantitative elemental analysis. It has been demonstrated that the main reason for the differences in the resolution values for LAMAS-10 are time aberrations by energies in the laser plasma drift space. The modification of the ion optics theory for LAMAS-10 allows the determination of the principles of the influence of the initial ion energies generated in the laser plasma on the resolution. The dependence of the conditions of the time focusing of ions by energies has been determined in a wide range of the initial values. This dependence provides software-controlled readjustment of the time focusing before the registration of the mass spectra for each initial ion energy. When time focusing of the ions was performed in a wide range of the initial energies, the resolution increased to R = 1300 at W = 50 eV, such parameters providing the quantitative analysis of solid bodies and powders."

In the molecules carrying two and more atoms of polyisotopic element in different positions (sites), the probability of detection of isotopes by sites in the pool (array) of analyzed molecules may be different, i.e., there is intramolecular isotopic heterogeneity by the specified element. Detection and quantitative estimation of isotopic heterogeneity of polyisotopic elements in molecules by the methods of isotopic mass spectrometry is a novel source of information about the processes involving the respective polyisotopic element. An isotopic equation has been proposed, the coefficients of which are normalized peak intensities of isotopically different molecular ions in the mass spectrum of the analyte. Solutions of this equation reflect the abundance ratios of isotopic atoms of polyisotopic element by its positions in molecules comprising the analyzed pool. During homogenous (equally probable) distribution of isotopic atoms of the element by all of its sites in molecules of the analyzed pool, solutions of the isotopic equation are equal to each other. In the case of non-homogenous isotope distribution of the polyisotopic element in the pool of molecules, solutions of the isotopic equation take on different values and may be presented by both real and complex numbers. Solutions of the isotopic equation reflect the peculiarities of distribution of element isotopes in a molecule and possible pathways of formation of a pool of analyzed molecules under laboratory and natural conditions."

The approach is based on the fact that the compounds can be divided into three groups by the type of fragmentation. The main group (O-alkyl, O-methyl, O-ethyl) containing almost all compounds of this class (61440 of 61460), in its turn, can be divided into ten subgroups characterized by different combinations of two N-alkyl radicals. Each subgroup possesses its specific generalized spectral image, i.e., a set of peaks characterized by mass numbers and relative intensities. A spectrum of an individual O-alkyl-N,N-dialkylphosphoramido cyanidate is considered as a sum of the generalized spectral image of a corresponding subgroup and a spectrum of an alkene with a carbon chain identical to the O-alkyl group of the molecule."
Comparative studies of the behavior of neutral and ionic ferrocene derivatives under different conditions of electrospray ionization,"December 2011, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/66-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934811130132,Articles,27 November 2011,"We have studied the behavior of ferrocene CpFeCp (FcH), ferrocenium triiodide [FcH]+I
−3
, dimethylaminomethylferrocene FcCH2NMe2 and its trimethylammonium salt [FcCH2NMe3]+I− under the conventional conditions of electrospray ionization (ESI), when the substance solution is subjected to spraying, and in two versions of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), when the sprayed solvent bombards the surface of solid or liquid samples. In addition to these techniques, the behavior of neutral compounds under conditions of electrospray ionization of vapors of the studied compounds in a gas phase (ESI_V) has been investigated. It has been shown using the examples of ferrocene and its dimethylaminomethyl derivative that the detection limits for these compounds occurring in a gas phase are comparable within an order of magnitude with their detection limits under the ESI and DESI conditions of solid and liquid samples. The high effectiveness of ionization of analyte vapors makes it possible to use the ESI method not only in combination with liquid (conventional ESI technology) and thin layer chromatography (DESI), but also with gas liquid chromatography (ESI_V). Thus, the electrospray ionization becomes a universal method allowing studies of a compound under the natural conditions in any state of aggregation, that is, solid, liquid, and gas. With the help of statistical methods for designing experiments (complete factorial experiment), quantitative evaluation of the influence of experimental parameters on the ion-formation processes under different ESI conditions has been carried out, which makes it possible to purposefully select the optimal conditions to record the ESI mass spectra with a minimum number of experiments. Moreover, analysis of the dependences of the mass spectra on the experimental parameters can serve as an instrument for studying the details of the ion-formation mechanisms depending upon different ways of ionization."

In the present research skin peptidome of wide-spread European frog Rana lessonae (Camerano, 1882) was studied for the first time ever. Peptide sequencing was accomplished with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer in collision-induced and electron capture dissociation modes. A portion of amphibian peptides contains intramolecular C-terminal disulfide cycle which obstructs mass spectrometric sequencing. Two methods were utilized to overcome this difficulty: reduction with dithiotreithol followed by thiol group alkylation and oxidation into sulfonic acid groups with performic acid. Integrated approach employed in the present study allowed the identification of 49 peptides (of 6 to 37 amino acid residues), including 19 novel species."
Expansion of a multicomponent laser plasma cloud,"December 2011, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/66-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934811130168,Articles,27 November 2011,It is shown that the mechanism of the electrodynamic expansion of a plasma cloud satisfactorily describes ion acceleration for two-component plasmas (ions of a fixed mass and electrons) but cannot be applied to the expansion of multicomponent plasmas. The main drawback of the known models is the assumption of the collision-free expansion of laser plasma clouds. It cannot be used to simulate the expansion of a multicomponent plasma cloud. An algorithm was proposed that takes into account collisions of ions with different masses in the electrodynamic model for the expansion of plasma clouds containing both matrix and trace contaminant ions. The algorithm and software on its basis allow one to calculate the energies of ions of different masses acquired in the process of ion acceleration in the laser plasma containing both matrix and contaminant ions. The results of numerical calculations are compared both with similar results obtained for the collision-free model of the expansion of the plasma cloud and with the experimental data. Taking into account collision processes in the electrodynamic model of plasma cloud expansion allows one to calculate the acceleration of trace contaminant ions in multicomponent laser plasma and reach a good qualitative agreement with the experimental data.

Although a method for their analysis is required for forensic toxicology authorities, the detection of synthetic cannabinoids is a complicated analytical task because of low anticipated concentrations in urine and the lack of in vivo data on their metabolism. Here, the urinary metabolites of 1-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole (JWH-018) and a procedure for determining them in urine are reported. Using gas and high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, two main monohydroxylated metabolites were identified in urine. Based on differences in their electron ionization MS/MS spectra, it is supposed that one of them is formed by the hydroxylation of an indole ring and the other, by the hydroxylation of a pentyl side chain. The main metabolites are almost completely excreted as conjugates with glucuronic acid. The structure of minor metabolites was proposed. The parent compound was not detected in urine at a level of 50 pg/mL 12 h after administration."

The results of molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the stabilization of such complexes in the gas phase can be due to the formation of a quasicyclic structure of the polymer chain around the chlorine anion and its coordination by CH2- and OH- groups of the oligomer. This structure is inverted towards the known quasicyclic structure of polyethers, in which metal cations are coordinated by oxygen atoms of ether groups."

This matter is of crucial importance when the results obtained approach the legal limits and is frequently ignored in scientific work. The aim of this study was the estimation of the global uncertainty associated to the determination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in aqueous samples, by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS), after solid-phase microextraction (SPME).

Many methods have been developed for monitoring the serum drug level. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), an electrochemical method advantaged by simple, inexpensive, and relatively short analysis time, has recently been developed for carbamazepine detection. We used a newly developed DPV method with glassy carbon as a working electrode to determine the carbamazepine level.

The titration of model solutions of casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA) shows that casein does not interact with electrogenerated bromine, while BSA reacts with the titrant in the ratio 1: 63. The proteins bind rutin and quercetin (from 14 to 90%) at a high rate and thus reduce the bioavailability of polyphenols. The concentration of free polyphenol is reduced with an increase in the concentration of protein in the mixture. The total antioxidant capacity (AOC) of tea is determined. Green tea is shown to possess higher AOC than the black one because of the partial oxidation of polyphenols to respective thearubigins and theaflavins at the fermentation step in the production of green tea. The total AOC of tea drops from 7 to 85%, in proportion to the increase in the amount of milk in the mixture. Milk proteins bind tea polyphenols into complexes because of intermolecular interactions and thus reduce their bioavailability. The observed effect of milk is independent of the brand of black tea. The degree of reduction of the total AOC of tea in going from one tea to another remains virtually constant."

By the example of contaminated samples of sediments and soils, the distribution of mercury between different forms has been studied. It has been demonstrated that, in the tested samples, mercury is present mainly in acid-soluble, organic, and residual (sulfide) fractions."

This method was based on the Fenton reaction that involved mixing of ferrous ions, hydrogen peroxide and sodium salicylate in acetic buffer medium. Ferrous ions, oxidized by hydrogen peroxide, formed with salicylate anion purple complex whose degradation started immediately. This effect was monitored by the decrease of absorbance at 525 nm. The experimental results showed that the most favorable conditions for complex degradation are: pH = 3.9, \( c_{Fe^{2 + } } \) = 4.7 × 10−5 M, and \( c_{Fe^{2 + } } /c_{H_2 O_2 } \) = 1/150. The activation energy (E
a) calculated from the slope (\( - \frac{{E_a }} {{2.303R}} \) = 2.84 × 103) was 54.3 ± 0.6 kJ/mol. The absorbance increased linearly with the increment of sodium salicylate concentration (r = 0.9983). The system obeyed Beer’s law in a range of 0.93–9.3 μg/mL of sodium salicylate concentration. The calculated values for the detection limit, according to two formulas, available in the literature, were found to be 0.67 and 0.48 μg/mL. The variables affecting the rate of the proposed reaction were investigated. The relative standard deviations for five-replicate determinations of 0.93, 3.31, and 9.30 μg/mL of sodium salicylate were calculated to be 6.80, 2.95, and 1.71%, respectively.

In this work, we introduce three criteria for the verification of peptide identification; these are based on the analysis of data orthogonal to tandem mass spectra. The first one utilizes chromatographic retention times of peptides. The development of such approaches has been hindered by the relatively low accuracy of retention time prediction algorithms. In this work, we suggest the use of two independent models of the liquid chromatography of peptides, which increase the reliability of the results. The second criterion utilizes the mean number of missed tryptic cleavages per peptide. The third one results from the analysis of the difference between theoretical and experimentally measured peptide masses. The proposed criteria were applied to the tandem mass spectra of tryptic peptides from rat kidney tissue, which were processed by the Mascot search engine. All the criteria showed that Mascot significantly overestimated the reliability of an identification. This conclusion was supported by the PeptideProphet algorithm."

About the plausible contribution of field ionization in the mechanism of the formation of dyes of ions under conditions of laser desorption/ionization from a nanostructurized graphite surface,"December 2010, issue 13",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/65-13,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934810130137,Articles,02 December 2010,"An approach is proposed for the estimation of the contribution of field ionization (FI) to the mechanism of dye ion formation under the conditions of laser desorption/ionization (LDI) from a nanostructurized graphite surface. As test systems, rough graphite layers with dyes, e.g., imidazophenazine derivatives applied to them were chosen; these ensure FI in a strong electric field. The dyes form three neutral precursors upon reduction and various types of ions in different ionization methods. It was found that the mass distribution within the group of peaks formed by the initial dye molecule and the products of its reduction in the positive ion mode upon LDI from a rough graphite surface is shifted to lower masses by one atomic mass unit in comparison to the distribution recorded for LDI from a smooth metal support. The analysis of plausible pathways of ion formation has shown that such a shift may be due to the superposition of ions formed by the FI mechanism on a graphite substrate with a number of ions formed by protonation in LDI with no dependence on the support type. In the negative ion mode, the registration of LDI dye spectra succeeded only if the graphite substrates used favored negative FI and electron emission enhanced by the field."

Dependence of analytical signal on the concentration of analyte in X-ray spectral analysis,"October 2010, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/65-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934810100047,Articles,06 October 2010,"The dependence of the intensity of analytical signals on the element concentrations expressed in weight percentages I(c) and atomic percentages I(a) in X-ray spectrochemical analysis is considered. It was shown that the change-over from the dependence I(a) to the dependence I(c), which took place in the 1950s, had no theoretical grounds, was based on an incorrect application of the concepts of density and Avogadro’s constant, and was accepted because of practical convenience. In the dependence I(c), the calibration characteristics becomes more complex; it requires corrections for matrix effects, even if these effects are absent. Analytical data published in weight percentages and obtained in the analysis of various samples by conventional X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRFA), X-ray radiometric analysis with an energy-dispersive spectrometer, absorption analysis, and electron probe microanalysis are recalculated into atomic percentages. These results and the data obtained by the author in the analysis of alloys and steels demonstrate a correlation between the intensity of characteristic lines and the atomic concentration of the components. If the calibration curve is based on I(a), a linear dependence over a wide range or the entire concentration range is observed in the majority of systems, the number of the necessary reference standard materials sharply decreases (to one), the sensitivity coefficient increases, and the corrections for matrix effects decrease or the necessity for them disappears."

In this study, investigation of synthesis and evaluation of diazinon imprinted polymers has been performed using equilibrium binding experiments. It is possible to use molecularly imprinted polymers as sorbents for anti-choline esterase (Anti-ChE) organophosphate pesticides (Ops). It has been found that MAA monomer is most suitable for the preparation of appropriate diazinon molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The type of porogen also influences the binding results. The best porogen for diazinon imprinting is chloroform due to its poor hydrogen bonding capacity."

The adsorbent was made of a polyacrylonitrile fiber, one layer of which was filled with an AV-17 anion exchanger (PANV-AV-17), while another layer, with a KU-2 cation exchanger (PANV-KU-2). The procedure was based on the simultaneous preconcentration of vanadium and chromium on the first disk and nickel and copper on the second disk, by pumping the analyzed solution through both disks in a flow-through cell. Then, vanadium was determined on the disk of PANV-AV-17 with 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid in 0.1 M HCl; next, chromium was determined with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide; the complex of vanadium was decomposed by 0.5 M H2SO4 and ascorbic acid. In the PANV-KU-2 disk, nickel was determined with dimethylglyoxime and then copper was analyzed with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate; the complex of nickel was decomposed with 1 M HCl.

It is shown that, in thermal lens spectrometry, the sensitivity of determination in such reactions can be increased by significantly increasing the sensitivity of thermo-optical measurements due to the formation of colloidal reaction products and the exploitation of the kinetic behavior of such reactions. Along with the increase in the sensitivity of absorbance measurements due to the thermo-optical effect itself, these factors also favor a gain in sensitivity in comparison to the spectrophotometry by 1–2 orders of magnitude."

A number of spectral changes were revealed: the appearance and disappearance of some absorption bands and batho- and hypsochromic shifts accompanied by the substantial rearrangement of the bands’ intensities. The observed effects are indicative of the change of the distribution of the charge within the molecule, the formation of new bonds, and rotational transformation in the formation of a chelate cycle. This confirms not only the presence of a complex in the polymer matrix but also that its structure is identical to the one found in solution before."

By virtue of the technique proposed, the values of pK

It is found that an increase in the basicity of the plasticizer leads to a sharp increase in the membrane selectivity to PAA cations with lower degrees of the substitution of the salt-forming nitrogen atom, and also to PAA cations with nonionic polar groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds with Lewis bases. PAA cations forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds are an exception. The effect of the nature of the ion exchanger on the selectivity to PAA cations is strongest when plasticizers with low basicity are used; the selectivity of membranes with plasticizers of high basicity does not depend on the nature of the ion exchanger. For ISEs based on the neutral carrier dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB-18-C-6), the best selectivity to primary amine cations in comparison to secondary and tertiary ones is achieved using plasticizers with low basicity."

This device functions on the basis of the level of light received by photoresistor (LDR), which is connected to a digit multimeter yielding resistance readings increasing with the increase in light absorption by sample solution. Experimental variables affecting the complex formation were optimized applying the Taguchi method. Under the optimum conditions, calibration plot was linear in the analyte concentration range of 0.1–2 μg/mL. The stoichiometry of metal/ligand ratio, the stability constant, and molar absorptivity (ɛ) of Cu(II)-SPAQ complex were also found. The relative standard deviation for five replicate determinations of 1 μg/mL Cu(II) was 3.64% and the corresponding limit of detection was 35 μg/L."

min) and determination (c
lim) limits of components described in the literature and presents a comparative analysis of the results of such evaluations. It is shown that use of the data on the fluctuations of the blank experiment, in spite of their wide application for such evaluations, gives ambiguous estimates for c
min and c
lim. The most correct method for evaluating the specified parameters is the experimental determination of the actual analyte concentration (content) from the empirical concentration dependence of the relative standard deviation. In case when this estimation method cannot be used, it is recommended to evaluate c

In the presence of perturbing radiation, the automatic setting of the spectrometer discrimination mode is not reasonable. When choosing the transmittance window, the dependence of the shift of the amplitude distribution on the counting rate should be taken into account. Losses of intensity can be significant. The value of effective dead time is 1.3 μs for spectrometers with flow methane-argon counters and 1.2–1.5 μs for spectrometric channels with sealed xenon counters. The mode of constant dead time is retained till the intensities of 100–150 kcps. The instrumental error of routine analysis is insignificant as compared with the statistical error of count collection. In the spectra from LiF crystals, a dip in intensities is adjacent to the shortwave wing of the AuL
α radiation line. Measuring intensities on it results in overestimates of the analyte concentration, and line weakening, which occurs because of the spectral hole, in contrast, leads to its underestimation. For this reason, in determining small concentrations of gold, using the L
α line as an analytical one seems unreasonable."

The active vapor phase is created either by pumping a gas through the chromatographic chamber or by introducing a solvent vapor from another part of the chamber. The composition and properties of the mobile phase are controlled immediately in the course of separation by means of absorption or adsorption of one or another gas with the mobile or stationary phase. By the examples of benzoic acids and nitroaniline isomers in the presence of carbon oxide and vapors of acetic acid, ammonia, and ethanol, it was shown that this procedure utilizes the difference in the protolytic and solvation properties of adsorbates for changing the adsorption equilibrium and the selectivity and efficiency of separation."

The new analytical method is possible by introducing a mediator which must be a weak acid and must be able to form an insoluble salt with a cation (a titrant). Theoretical expressions of pH, as well as the concentrations of all other species, were derived and solved numerically using bisection method. Among the various factors that influence pH during the titration, concentrations of the mediator and initial values of pH were proved to be very critical.

In both methods, the amount of in situ generated bromine corresponds to the SMT content. The experimental conditions are optimized. Titrimetry is applicable over 1–10 mg range and the calculations are based on the molar ratio of 1: 0.666 (SMT: KBrO3).

Oxidation peaks of sorbite emerge in cyclic voltammograms recorded in alkaline supporting electrolytes (0.05–0.10 M KOH and NaOH solutions) upon scanning the potential to the anodic region (E
p = 0.50–0.58 V) and in the reverse direction (E

It was found that, in contrast to other microorganisms, spirulina predominantly assimilates nontoxic, essential Cr(III) species rather than the toxic Cr(VI) species. Photometry and EPR proved the absence of toxic chromium species with high degrees of oxidation in the course of Cr(III) accumulation by S. platensis cells. The relationship between the Cr(III) concentration in the chromium-containing spirulina biomass and the chromium concentration in the nutrient medium was found; it can be used for the determination of Cr(III) concentrations necessary for cell cultivation. The control of the protein composition and cytological status of cells showed that the S. platensis biomass assimilated Cr(III) in necessary concentrations under the selected conditions retained its protein composition and useful natural properties, and, hence, could be used for medical and preventive purposes."

The carbon paste electrode (CPE) has been modified by using [N,N′-bis(2-pyridine carboxamido)-1,2-benzene] nickel(II) complex (Ni(II)bpb) and the electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode has been studied by cyclic voltammetry. The modified electrode shows an excellent electrocatalytic effect on the oxidation of DA. Under optimum conditions, calibration plots are found to be linear in the range of 7.0 × 10−7−1.0 × 10−5 M (r

An algorithm based on the use of wave spectra is proposed for determining the parameters of the functions. It is found that the calculated values of some parameters of approximation functions considerably differ from those presented by the authors of the functions. It is found that the quality of approximating bremsstrahlung X-radiation is strongly affected by the method of calculating the average atomic number of the sample and the corrections for matrix effects. In the wavelength range 0.1 ≤ λ ≤ 1.2 nm for atomic numbers 10 ≤ Z ≤ 83 and accelerating voltages 15 ≤ E

In 0.1 M HAc-NaAc buffer solution (pH 5.6), the reduction peaks of p -DHB and o -DHB were partly separated by differential pulse voltammetry at the glassy carbon electrode. By adding a surfactant (cetyl pyridinium chloride) to enhance the detection sensitivity and using a semi-derivative technique to improve the separation, p-DHB and o-DHB were detected simultaneously. The linear calibration ranges were 1.2 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−4 M for p -DHB and 8.2 × 10−7 to 1.0 × 10−4 M for o -DHB, with detection limits of 3.6 × 10−7 and 2.4 × 10−7 M, respectively. The proposed method has been applied to the direct determination of DHB isomers in water sample, and the results were excellent."

 can be estimated from the ascending wing of the peak. It is shown that the steady-state mode with the zero rate of entropy production is reproduced at the moment of peak registration because of the equilibrium of entropy because of the chemical reaction and the diffusion and transfer of the sample plug through the detector. It was supposed that the accurate reproduction of this condition in registering each peak results in the high reproducibility of the results of measurements in FIA. The correlation between the rate of entropy production and the degree of reaction proceeding in the flow-injection system, which is easily determined experimentally, is studied. It is shown that a convenient criterion of the optimization of various systems can be the degree of reaction proceeding extrapolated to the zero rate of entropy production.

We compared the response characteristics of the solid-contact electrodes (SCEs) based on these ionophores and various plasticizers. Among the three ionophores, 4′,4″(5″)-di-tert-butyldibenzo-18-crown-6-ether-based SCE produced the best results exhibiting a high reproducibility with negligible drifts in the standard potential with a response slope (RS) of 58.2 mV/decade: the detection limit (DL) of the potassium ion was 10−5.80 M with linearity over five decades. This is a significant improvement for the response slope and detection limit compared to SCEs with valinomycin, 2,3-naphtho-15-crown-ether, and dibenzo-15-crown-5-ether ionophore, which showed 53–56 mV/decade of RS and 10−5.3 M of DL.

While the interfering ion concentration was changing between 5 and 40 000 mg/L, the Mo concentration was taken as 10, 20 and 40 mg/L. It was shown that even at low concentrations of interfering ion there was a large suppression of Mo absorbance. No absorbance was observed for Mo in the presence of 50 time higher concentration of Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. These interference effects were suppressed by additions of 0.04% (m/v) sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (Na-DDTC), 2% (m/v) ammonium chloride, and 0.4% (m/v) sodium hydrogen phosphate. The interference from another group of elements, Mn, Fe, Al, Cd, Ni, Cr, Co, Cu and Zn, has been also investigated. In the presence of above mentioned metals, except Mn, the reproducibility of Mo absorption signal was not satisfactory. In the presence of Mn (5–40000 mg/L) the absorbance of Mo decreased significantly, however, the reproducibility was high. Molybdenum absorbance decreased under the influence of 5000–40000 mg/L of Fe, Co, Ni, 500–40000 mg/L of Cr. On the other hand, the absorption signal of Mo increased at about 20–40% in the presence of Zn and Cd. By the addition of 2% NH4Cl the interference of these metals could be eliminated completely for all mass ratios of Mn: Mo and up to Mo: M mass ratio of 1: 10–1: 100 for the other metals, and reliable absorbance signals of Mo were obtained."

It was demonstrated that the gain in these characteristics of the thermal lens determination in the given medium in comparison with the aqueous medium does not necessarily coincide with the strength of the thermooptical effect in this medium. It was demonstrated that the optimum conditions of measurements in the thermal lens detection are controlled not only by the absorption of the analyte and the reagents, but also by the intrinsic absorption of the solvent. Recommendations were given on the selection of the solvent for analytical thermal lens spectrometry."

The threshold is derived in a Bayesian framework, and previously used on the wavelet coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution. The threshold is simple and closed form, which is adaptive to each subband because it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Using this strategy, the noise in the signal of the DNA-separated analysis by capillary electrophoresis could be removed adequately. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising method is effective, and the spatially adaptive thresholding yields a lower root-mean-square error than the universal thresholding."

Upon the adsorption of the reagent on solid matrices, a bathochromic shift of absorption bands is observed in comparison with its absorption in solutions. The analysis of sorption isotherms and IR spectra suggested that the reagent can be fixed on the matrix by hydrogen bonds, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions. An increased ability of the complexes of metal ions with Chromazurol S to adsorb on the matrices was noted; a significant (100–130 nm) bathochromic shift of the absorption bands in comparison with the absorption of the complexes in aqueous solutions is observed in this case, and the number of ligands coordinated by the metal ion also increases. Based on the study of the sorption isotherms and absorption spectra in the visible and IR regions for complexes, the assumption of the hydrophobic hydration of the resulting complexes in the intermicellar space of the matrix was suggested.

The distribution constants of the substances and the increments of the methylene and hydroxyl groups of the alcohols in the logarithm of the distribution constant were calculated. It was found that an increase in the salt concentration in the aqueous phase resulted in a considerable increase in the increment of the methylene group and significantly improved the alcohol separation efficiency. The dependence of the distribution coefficients of ethanol and butanol on the concentration of ethanol in the aqueous phase was studied. A dramatic decrease in the increment of the methylene group was found as the ethanol concentration in the salt phase was increased above 4.5 vol %. A procedure was developed for extraction sample preparation for the subsequent determination of the characteristic components of cognac products and for the authentication of these products by gas chromatography. The essence of this procedure consists in the hexane extraction of butanol and other hydrophobic substances from cognac product samples prediluted with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate. In this case, the major portion of ethanol, as well as hydrophilic and thermally unstable impurities, which complicate analysis with direct sample injection, remained in the salt solution. The procedure was tested with 16 samples of cognac and cognac spirits from Georgia, including both authentic and adulterated products."

The molar absorptivity values as obtained from Beer’s law data were found to be 0.812 × 104, 0.947 × 104, 0.927 × 104, and 0.709 × 104 L/(mol cm), while Sandell’s sensitivity values were observed to be 412.03, 25.15, 20.44, and 27.81 ng/cm2 for ABT, MDP, DPH, and LDP, respectively. Common excipients did not interfere with the proposed method. The results of the proposed methods compare favorably with those of official methods. The proposed method offers a simplicity, reliability, rapidity, and accuracy compared to the existing methods."

The presence of formaldehyde can sensitize CL emission because it may accelerate the generation of 1O2 (1Δg). The optimum conditions for the CL emission were chosen. The relationships between the relative CL intensity and the concentration of the studied analytes are linear with the correlation coefficients in the range of 0.9959–0.9989.

The hepatic fibrosis marker lamin (LN) and its antibody anti-lamin (α-LN) are selected to illustrate the functionality of the sensor. MEMS technology endows this sensor with the features of a small size, a high reproducibility, a low cost, and the potential integration with IC circuitry for portable applications. The sensor is characterized by impedance spectroscopy and calibrated by cyclic voltammetry. The active-site density is found to be directly related to the copolymerization cycles and antibody concentration. The results show that controlling the current in the range from −16 to −13 μA at 0.8 V provides the optimized semi-insulation characteristic that is most suitable for all detections. The impedance analysis reveals that a low-frequency measurement for concentration-dependent impedance is applicable for such a sensor. The evaporation of the electrolyte is found to be responsible for the impedance changes at a very high frequency. The sensitivity of the immunosensor to LN is 0.6208%/(ng/mL) with a linear detection concentration range between 0 and 90 ng/mL."

The method is based on a combination of chemometric data interpretation and the calculation of the minimum standard deviation (STDEV) of experiments. From the depiction of the STDEV of a straight line versus the residuals, the more favorable concentration range of calibration could be obtained by iteration using only a few steps. This condition links the lower limit of analysis (LLA) to an upper limit of analysis (ULA), and, thus, completes the statistically appropriate extension of the calibration line. In addition, a minimum STDEV of measurement was expressed in terms of the STDEV on the slope (s

a
) and on the intercept (s

b
), and the calculation was performed by using a modified version of the law of propagation of errors (LPE). The method was validated on experiments of gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), electrochemistry, flow-injection analysis (FIA), atomic emission spectrometry (AES), flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), and inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A novel definition of the ULA was proposed as the concentration where the response started to deviate significantly from linearity, also taking into account the level of uncertainty. The proposed method facilitates the determination of the concentration range of calibration and LLA in one working operation. In order to promote reliability, it was proposed that the number of repetitions of analysis should be high, preferably above 100, in order to fulfill the conditions of the central-limit theorem."

It was shown that, for some adsorbents, retention decreases with an increase in the salt concentration, while an opposite dependence was observed for the other adsorbents. Such behavior of adsorbates can be explained by the prevailing silanophilic interactions in the former case and hydrophobic interactions in the latter case. The observed dependence can be used to change the chromatographic selectivity in the analysis of complex mixtures containing organic bases and to assess the properties of reversed-phase columns.

The method is based on the extraction of a Mo(V)-ferron (7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulphonic acid) complex into trioctylamine-chloroform in a sulphuric acid medium using ascorbic acid as a reductant. Many elements such as Re(VII), W(VI), U(VI), Th(IV), Cr(III), Cr(VI), V(V), Ce(IV), Ru(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Cd(II), Mg(II), Cu(II), Al(III), Zn(II), Pb(II), Ag(I), and As(V) are not extracted under the conditions proposed and, thus, molybdenum can be easily separated without any interference. Sulphate, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and oxalate anions have no effect on the extraction of molybdenum. However, zirconium and palladium interfere seriously. The ratio of Mo: ferron: TOA in the extracted species is found to be 1: 1: 3 using Job’s method of continuous variations. This value has been further confirmed by the mole-ratio method."

Simple spectrophotometric method for the determination of sulfur dioxide by its decolorizing effect on the peroxovanadate complex,"March 2008, issue 3",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/63-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934808030088,Articles,25 March 2011,"A simple, rapid, and economical spectrophotometric method is developed for the determination of sulfur dioxide in sugar and air samples. The developed method is based on a red-brown peroxovanadate complex (λmax = 470 nm) produced in 2 M sulfuric acid when ammonium metavanadate is treated with hydrogen peroxide. Under fixed concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and ammonium metavanadate, when sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5 = 2SO2) is added, it preferentially reacts with hydrogen peroxide producing sulfuric acid, and the unreacted hydrogen peroxide then reacts with ammonium metavanadate; therefore, the concentration of sulfur dioxide is directly proportional to a decrease in the concentration of the peroxovanadate complex. The stoichiometric ratio between hydrogen peroxide and ammonium metavanadate as well as the stability constant of the complex are determined by the modified Job’s method and the respective values are found to be 1: 1 and 2.5 × 104 mol−1 L, respectively. The system obeys Lambert-Beer’s law in the concentration range 3.57–64.26 ppm of sulfur dioxide. The molar absorptivity, correlation coefficient, and Sandell’s sensitivity values are found to be 0.649 × 103 L mol−1 cm−1, 0.9908, and 0.1972 μg cm−2, respectively. The method is applied to the determination of sulfur dioxide present in commercial sugars and air samples. The results obtained are reproducible with a standard deviation of 0.02–0.05.

p) are determined in cyclic voltammograms of dihydroxybenzene/p-benzoquinone redox systems at an electrode made of a graphite-epoxy composite in a wide pH range. The data obtained (ΔE
p = 29 ± 1 mV) are close to the thermodynamic values for two-electron reversible reactions. This indicates that the electrode mechanically renewed by cutting a 0.5-μm surface layer directly in a test solution exhibits a high activity in such electrochemical reactions. The potentials of anodic and cathodic peaks are proportional to the pH of the supporting electrolyte solution in the range from 1.0 to 9.0. A change of 58 ± 1 mV in E
p per unit pH for all isomers shows that the first stage of the oxidation of each dihydroxybenzene isomer involves one electron and is accompanied by the detachment of one hydrogen ion, that is, an intermediate oxidation product, semiquinone, is formed. Despite the closeness of the potentials of hydroquinone and pyrocatechol peaks (ΔE = 100 mV), a scheme is proposed for the selective voltammetric determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers in a 0.1 M HCl solution in hydroquinone-pyrocatechol, pyrocatechol-resorcinol, and hydroquinone-resorcinol binary mixtures. The concentrations of hydroquinone and pyrocatechol are found from cathodic peaks and that of resorcinol, from the anodic peak. The results are well reproducible and contain no systematic error."

Conditions controlling the character of the sensor signal were revealed. The donor signal of the sensor increases with increasing temperature of the sensor, increasing air humidity, and decreasing concentration of hydrogen chloride. On the contrary, a decrease in the temperature of the sensor, a decrease in humidity, and an increase in the concentration of hydrogen chloride enhance the acceptor signal of the sensor.

The Cu2+-NH3 complex (with λmax = 600 nm) was decomposed by citrate ion and formed a Cu2+-citrate complex (with λmax = 740 nm). On the other hand, during the reaction of ascorbic acid with copper(II)-ammonia complex, ascorbic acid is oxidized and the copper(II)-ammonia complex is reduced to the copper(I)-ammonia complex and the absorbance decreases to 600 nm. Although there is a spectral overlap between the absorbance spectra of complexes Cu2+-NH3 and Cu2+-citrate, they have been simultaneously determined using an artificial neural network (ANN). The absorbances at 600 and 740 nm were used as the input layer. The ANN architectures were different for citric and ascorbic acid. The output of the citric acid ANN architecture was used as an input node for the ascorbic acid ANN architecture. This modification improves the capability of the ascorbic acid ANN model for the prediction of ascorbic acid concentrations. The dynamic ranges for citric and ascorbic acid were 1.0–125.0 and 1.0–35.0 mM, respectively. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of citric and ascorbic acids in vitamin C tablets and some powdered drink mixes."

Zeolite molecular sieves with pore sizes of 3, 4, and 5 Å were all suitable for chemical deposition and subsequent voltammetric quantitation of trace Co(II). In order to cover a large range of parameters, the investigations were carried out using three zeolites (A, X, and Y), selected for their different cation-exchange capacities and ion-sieving properties. The analytical scheme, “preconcentration/voltammetric detection” for the determination of cobalt(II) species using zeolite-modified carbon paste electrodes (ZMCPE) was chosen. Compared to the corresponding unmodified electrodes, improvements in sensitivity were observed when using ZMCPEs due to analyte accumulation at the electrode’s surface by ion exchange in zeolite particles. The detection limit obtained for Co(II) was 3 ppm following 15 min of chemical deposition. A good correlation was found between the results obtained by ion exchange voltammetry and conventional ion-exchange characterization."

It is shown that the DNA-antibody interaction changes the rate of polyaniline doping in transferring the DNA sensor from an alkaline (pH 7.5) solution, which is optimum for the immunochemical reaction, to an acidic (pH 3.0) solution. The dynamics of the variation of the DNA sensor potential depends on the titer of antibodies and their origin. The dependence of the DNA sensor signal on the dilution of the blood sera from systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thyroiditis patients shows that DNA antibodies can be diagnosed by the characteristic maximum in the dilution curve found in the range of serum dilutions from 1: 20 to 1: 50."

About the dependence of the intensity of X-ray spectra of elements on their concentrations expressed in atomic and mass percents,"November 2007, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/62-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934807110159,Letters to the Editor Scientific Discussions,November 2007,"The consideration of the classical physical fundamentals of X-ray spectrometry suggests that the properties of X-ray spectra of elements are determined by their atomic number rather than atomic weight. The intensity of X-ray spectra is determined by the number of excited atoms rather by their mass. However, in the middle of the 20th century, the dependence of intensity on the mass concentration of elements was introduced without any physical grounds. The paper presents physical, analytical, and metrological evidences for the idea that this dependence does not correspond to a real physical process. It results in distorted calibration characteristics and extra errors and hinders the development of a method of universal (for all element systems) quantitative X-ray fluorescence analysis instead of specific procedures with empirical parameters for each particular system. The dependence on atomic concentrations eliminates these difficulties."

Chromatographic determination of phthalic acid esters as an indicator of adulterated cognacs and cognac spirits,"August 2007, issue 8",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/62-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934807080126,Articles,August 2007,"Based on the study performed, a conclusion was drawn that a system of procedures should be introduced into the practice of arbitration laboratories in order to identify the authenticity of cognacs and cognac spirits. These procedures were exemplified in the identification of diethyl phthalate in cognacs. Factors responsible for the falsely positive detection of diethyl phthalate in cognacs and cognac spirits were revealed. A substance that has a retention time equal to that of diethyl phthalate was identified as monoethyl succinate. As an example, recommendations were given for revealing adulterated cognac samples upon the detection of phthalic acid esters in them (including diethyl phthalate, which is a marker of denaturation). Sources of the contamination of test samples with diethyl phthalate were identified; an algorithm was developed for distinguishing between diethyl phthalate as an impurity component and diethyl phthalate added to an alcohol as a denaturation marker."

These reactions are accompanied by the formation of intensely colored diazo compounds with a high contrast (more than 100 nm). The formation, stability, and optical properties of these compounds in solutions were supported by quantum-chemical calculations. The kinetic stability of diazo compounds was found to be sufficient for the flow-injection detection of an output peak. Trypaflavine was found to be the best and most sensitive reagent; in this case, the diazotization reaction in 0.2 MHCl occurred especially rapidly and almost completely with a degree of conversion of 0.98. A procedure for the determination of nitrite ions based on the reaction with trypaflavine was developed. The combination of on-line preconcentration on an EDE-10P anion-exchange resin and the reaction at the instant of elution in a flow system allowed us to determine selectively low nitrite concentrations in water with the limit of detection equal to 2 ng/mL, as calculated according to Kaiser (3s) or IUPAC.

It was found that large negative values of the homological increments of these constants can serve as a sign of fluorine derivatives that contain no less than three fluorine atoms per molecule. The retention indices on polar inorganic sorbents, the silica gels Silipor 75 and Silipor 600, were chosen as the second chromatographic parameter. On these sorbents (unlike partition separation), the nonadditivity effect of the retention indices of polyfunctional organic compounds with respect to their simpler structural analogs was found for the first time. It was found that a mutual correlation between indices for this combination of a phase and a sorbent was lower than that for the combinations of phases with different polarities; this fact is responsible for the higher information content of this combination for the identification of compounds from this class."

It is shown that the numerical characteristic of the relative position of trend lines in the coordinates logk(B) vs. logk(A) of the relative retention parameters (at different mobile phase compositions) for any stationary phase relative to the stationary phase selected as a standard is preferable to the separation selectivity of the same pair of substances. Full information can be obtained by determining the retention of corresponding adsorbates with two different mobile phase compositions for each column under study. It was shown that the pair of adsorbates p-toluidine-p-cresol exhibits higher sensitivity to a change in the hydrophilicity of stationary phases as compared to the pair aniline-phenol.

The spectrophotometric method is much more sensitive than most of the procedures known for the determination of SBS. The titrimetric method takes less than 15 min for analysis. All the procedures are simple and do not need elaborate treatment or tedious extractions. One titrimetric and two spectrophotometric methods are described for the assay of sulbutamol sulphate (SBS) in bulk drugs and in tablets using bromate-bromide mixture and two dyes, rhodamine B and methylene blue, as reagents. In titrimetry, an aqueous solution of SBS is treated with a measured excess of bromate-bromide mixture in a HCl medium, followed by iodometric determination of unreacted bromine. Spectrophotometric methods involve the addition of a known excess of bromate-bromide mixture to SBS in an acid medium, followed by the determination of residual bromine by reacting with either a fixed amount of rhodamine-B and measuring the absorbance at 555 nm (method A) or methylene blue and measuring the absorbance at 665 nm (method B). In all methods, the amount of in situ generated bromine reacted corresponds to the amount of SBS. The titrimetric method is applicable over the 3.0–8.0 mg range and the reaction stoichiometry is found to be 1: 2 (SBS: KBrO3). In spectrophotometric methods, the absorbance is found to increase linearly with the concentration of SBS which is corroborated by the correlation coefficient of 0.9978 and 0.9991 for method A and method B, respectively. The systems obey Beer’s law for 0.25–2.5 μg/mL (method A) and 0.75–7.5 μg/mL (method B).

A sufficiently high capacity of the polymer gel causes the formation of a relatively large amount of immobilized compounds, which makes it possible to conduct different types of synthetic analytical reactions of the formation of azo dyes in these gelatin gels in the real-time mode. It was demonstrated that, in all cases, the rate-determining step is external diffusion. These effects were used for the preparation of irreversible sensing elements suitable for measurements of calibration functions using the fixed-time technique or the tangent method in the determination of nitrites in solutions."

In the present investigation, the use of a syringe loaded with sorbent for the separation and enrichment of Cr(III), Ni(II), and Zn(II) prior to their determination by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was proposed to substitute the batch and column techniques. The described method was compared with the column technique with respect to fastness, simplicity, recovery, and risk of contamination. The syringe was loaded with 1.0 g of sorbent in order to retain the analyte elements. Next, 7.0 mL of sample solution (pH 5.0 ± 0.2) was drawn into the syringe in 15 s and discharged over 15 s. Then, an eluent (3.0 M HCl) was drawn into the syringe and ejected back to desorb the analyte elements. At the optimum conditions, the percentage recoveries of Cr(III), Ni(II), and Zn(II) were in the range of 94.50 to 99.62% with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 0.03%. The elements could be concentrated by drawing and discharging several portions of sample successively and eluting only one time. The detailed study of various interferences proved the method to be highly selective. The risk of contamination is less than that with the column technique. The method was successfully applied to the determination of Cr(III), Ni(II), and Zn(II) in spiked and natural water samples. The results obtained are in good agreement with those obtained by the reported methods at the 95% confidence level."

The ligand 1-(2-pyridylazo)2-naphthol (PAN) and its metal complexes (Zn-PAN and Cu(II)-PAN) were made water-soluble by the neutral surfactant Triton X-100, and therefore, no extraction with organic solvents was required. The method is based on the difference in absorbance of formed complexes between Zn2+ and PAN, at two different wavelengths at pH = 9.2. The formation of both the complexes was complete within five minutes. Zn2+ can be determined in the range of 0.2–25 µg/mL with satisfactory accuracy and precision in the presence of excess of Cu2+ and most other metal ions. Interference effects of common anions and cations were studied.

It has been demonstrated by both experimental and theoretical considerations that better results can be obtained by a proper selection of the spectral range to be included in calculations. A genetic algorithm is one of the most popular methods for selecting variables for PLS calibration of mixtures with almost identical spectra without loss of prediction capacity. In this work, a simple and precise method for rapid and accurate simultaneous determination of sulfide and sulfite ions based on the addition reaction of these ions with new fuchsin at pH 8 and 25°C by PLS regression and using a genetic algorithm (GA) for variable selection is proposed. The concentrations of sulfide and sulfite ions varied between 0.05–2.50 and 0.15–2.00 µg/mL, respectively. A series of synthetic solutions containing different concentrations of sulfide and sulfite were used to check the prediction ability of GA-PLS models. The root mean square error of prediction with PLS on the whole data set was 0.19 µg/mL for sulfide and 0.09 µg/mL for sulfite. After the application of GA, these values were reduced to 0.04 and 0.03 µg/mL, respectively."

The ratio of components in the reaction products (piazoselenols) of 1: 1 was determined by elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and the isomolar series method. The formation of the selenium-nitrogen bond was confirmed and the quasiaromatic character of piazoselenols was revealed by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Binding energies of valence orbitals, electron density distribution, and charges of nitrogen and selenium atoms were estimated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In the case of piazoselenol from 1,2-phenylenediamine, the existence of two tautomeric forms with the oxidation numbers of selenium close to +2 and +4 were found. Piazoselenol based on N-phenyl-1,2-phenylenediamine predominantly occurs as a single compound with the oxidation number of selenium close to +2.

The proposed membrane sensor can be used for at least 6 months without any divergence in its potentials. The electrode was successfully applied as an indicator electrode in the titration of triiodide with thiosulfate ion."

Chrome Azurol S, Sulfochrome, and Eriochrome Cyanine R were used for immobilization. It was found that the reagents are weakly retained on cellulose matrices. The degree of retention varied from 10 to 60%. It was observed that the reagent complexes of metal ions exhibited enhanced adsorbability on the matrices. Cloths with immobilized Chrome Azurol S were used in the test determination of 0.0005–0.5 mg/L beryllium and 0.0005–1.0 mg/L aluminum. When the reaction products were preconcentrated on the cloth from 100 mL of a test solution, the detection limit was 0.0001 mg/L. Procedures were developed for determining 0.1–100 mg/L aluminum and 0.02–0.6 mg/L beryllium in solutions using cloth test strips encapsulated into a polymeric film. It was demonstrated that Sulfochrome and Eriochrome Cyanine R immobilized on cloths can be used to determine 0.01–1 and 1–1000 mg/L cationic surfactants."

The diamino derivative of calix[4]arene was first diazotized and coupled with o-vanillinsemicarbazone to obtain a new “upper-rim” functionalized calix[4]arene-o-vanillinsemicarbazone. It was then covalently linked to the Merrifield peptide resin and characterized by FT-IR and elemental analysis. Quantitative studies were carried out by spectrophotometry and ICP-AES with a relative standard deviation of 1.7%. Various physicochemical parameters like pH, concentration of eluting agents, flow rate, total sorption capacity, metal-ligand stoichiometry, exchange kinetics, preconcentration factor, distribution coefficient, breakthrough capacity, resin stability, and effect of electrolytes and associated metal ions have been studied. The uptake and stripping of these metal ions on the resin was fast, indicating a better accessibility of La(III) and Ce(III) towards the chelating sites. Detection limits corresponded to three times the standard deviation of the blank (3σB) and amounted to 3.05 and 6.86 µg/L, along with preconcentration factors of 153 and 133 for La(III) and Ce(III), respectively. The robustness of the procedure is demonstrated by the recoveries obtained (>97.5%) for La(III) and Ce(III) in the presence of several cations and anions. The proposed method was satisfactorily applied to the separation of La(III) and Ce(III) from each other and also from U(VI) and Th(IV) by sequential acidic elution and varying pH. The validity of the method was tested by analyzing these metal ions in monazite sand and standard geological materials."

CV studies indicate that the process is irreversible and adsorption-controlled. The experimental parameters which influence the peak current responses of OF, NF, GF, and LF were studied. The reduction peak currents of OF, NF, GF, and LF change linearly over the common concentration range from 3.2 × 10−8 to 2 × 10−5 M, with a common correlation coefficient and limit of detection of 0.9995 and 2.4 × 10−8 M, respectively, in pH 4.0 Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer at an accumulation time of 160 s.

The concentration dependence of the relative standard deviation of the determination of water by the Karl Fisher method is found to be linear in RSD-1/c coordinates. To exclude the effect of moisture contained in the titration flask, it is suggested to bind water with a titrant in the presence of a small amount of methanol. The methanol effect (that is, the dependence of the titration results on the water: methanol ratio and the total amount of the titrated water-methanol mixture) is shown to be eliminated in the presence of the products of water interaction with Karl Fisher reagent that form on the water binding stage. It is found that the use of a background dye, methylene blue, eliminates significant systematic errors in the determination of water by the Karl Fisher method, particularly, at low concentrations. It is noted that the visual detection of the titration end-point has some advantages over the automated electrometric versions of the method; in particular, it is characterized by a better reproducibility of the determination of low concentrations of water."

The Pd-CPTR, Pt-CPTR, and Rh-CPTR chelates can absorbed onto the front of the enrichment column (ZORBAX Stable Bound, 4.6 × 10 mm, 1.8 μm) when they are injected with a buffer solution of 0.05 M sodium acetate-acetic acid (pH 3.5) as mobile phase. After the enrichment had finished, by switching the six-port switching valve, the retained chelates were back-flushed by mobile phase and moved towards the analytical column. The chelate separation on the analytical column (ZORBAX Stable Bound, 4.6 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) was achieved with 46% acetonitrile (containing 0.05 M of pH 3.5 sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer and 0.01 M tritonX-100) as mobile phase. The palladium, platinum, and rhodium were separated completely within 2 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of palladium, platinum, and rhodium are 1.4, 1.6, and 2.0 ng/L, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of palladium, platinum, and rhodium in water, urine, and soil samples with good results."

The entire extract was trapped from a gas flow in a sorption device at the extractor outlet and thermally desorbed into a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument. The extracted compounds were identified either by the direct processing of GC-MS data or using the CODA mathematical algorithm. The combination of solventless SFE with the transfer of the entire extract into a GC-MS instrument with the direct analysis of GC-MS data allowed us to determine organic compounds at a level of 3.9 pg/mg hair. The CODA mathematical algorithm for the processing of GC-MS data allowed us to determine compounds at a level of 1.7 pg/mg hair; in the majority of publications, this determination limit was achieved either by selective ion detection or using a GC-MS-MS technique."

It was found that all of the samples were prepared from high-purity food or hydrolysis ethanol (characteristic impurity compounds that are the markers of synthetic alcohol were absent), which met the requirements of GOST (State Standard) R 51698-2000. In the samples of illegal alcohol (from Kyzyl), diethyl phthalate (850–1284 mg/L) and, in one sample, ethylene glycol (380 mg/L, accidental contaminant) were found. The occurrence of diethyl phthalate indicated that vodka (aqueous alcohol mixture) was prepared from commercial denatured alcohol. An analysis of regulatory documents and published data allowed us to draw the following conclusions: (1) diethyl phthalate does not meet the requirements imposed on denaturing additives, and it is used as a denaturing agent only in Russia; (2) the test samples of illegal alcohol do not differ from food ethanol solutions of analogous strength in terms of acute toxicity parameters; and (3) surrogate alcohols in illicit trade are not the main reason for high mortality from alcohol intoxication in the test region (Kyzyl and the Tyva Republic)."

The electrochemical oxidation of ascorbic acid was investigated by cyclic, linear sweep, differential pulse (DPV), and square wave (SWV) voltammetry. For analytical purposes, a very well-resolved diffusion-controlled voltammetric peak was obtained in acetate buffer at pH 3.50 for DPV and SWV. The linear response was obtained in the range of 3.52–176.1 μg/mL with a detection limit of 0.88 μg/mL for DPV and 0.52 µg/mL for SWV. Based on this study, simple, rapid, selective, and sensitive voltammetric methods were developed for the determination of ascorbic acid in pharmaceutical dosage forms and Rosa species (R. dumalis ssp. boissieri var. boissieri, R. canina, R. pulverulenta, R. heckeliana ssp. vanheurckiana, and R. montana subsp. woronowii). The results obtained are compared with the HPLC data. The developed methods enable the extracts to be analyzed without the necessity of any time-consuming separation."
Potentiometric determination of water-soluble organic amides using tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid,"November 2006, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806110141,Articles,November 2006,A procedure is based on the potentiometric titration of water-soluble nitrogen-containing organic compounds with tungstophosphoric acid in an HCl solution using a polarized platinum microelectrode. The analytical range is between 0.4 and 65%. The presence of isobutanol and LiCl in industrial solutions has no effect on determination in a wide concentration range and allows the procedure to be used in the production of some synthetic fibers.
Lipophilic ionic additive for controlling the selectivity of ion-selective electrodes reversible to cations of nitrogen-containing organic bases,"November 2006, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806110153,Articles,November 2006,"The effect of a lipophilic ionic additive, a tetradecylammonium salt of a liquid ion exchanger, on the selectivity of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for cations of nitrogen-containing organic bases was studied. Additive-containing ISEs exhibited a higher selectivity for cations of primary to tertiary amines as compared to that for quaternary ammonium cations. A maximum change in selectivity (up to more than two orders of magnitude) due to the introduction of tetradecylammonium was observed for membranes containing dinonyladipate as a plasticizer and tris(nonyloxy)benzene sulfonic acid as an ion exchanger. In this case, the introduction of lipophilic ionic additive may lead to the reversal of the selectivity series. The effect of the lipophilic ionic additive on the selectivity of ISEs with membranes plasticized with o-nitrophenyl octyl ether decreased approximately by an order of magnitude. The selectivity of ISEs with the membranes containing tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl) borate as a cation exchanger was virtually independent of the presence of lipophilic ionic additives. The results obtained were explained by the peculiarities of ion-pair formation in the membrane."

Construction of a multivariate calibration by the simple interval calculation method,"October 2006, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806100030,Articles,October 2006,"Simple interval calculation is a method for linear modeling and for constructing interval estimates of predictions in a multivariate calibration. Simple interval calculation gives results in a convenient interval form with regard to all the existing uncertainties: measurement errors of predictors and responses, discrepancies of bilinear modeling, and so on. In addition, the simple interval calculation method opens new opportunities for constructing an informative classification of object significance. The method is based on only the assumption of the error boundedness; it uses linear programming algorithms for data analysis. This approach differs substantially from the conventional regression methods used in chemometrics and, therefore, is poorly understood by analysts. This paper gives an elementary explanation of the simple interval calculation method illustrated by the simplest model and real examples."

Significant changes in the subject of publications, as well as in methodology and terminology, are noted over the period under review and compared to those over the earlier period. This is due to going from traditional studies to studies in the field of micro-and nanosized samples. The contributions of amperometry, electrochemiluminescence, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, impedance measurements, spectroelectrochemical methods, and electrochemical microscopy have increased. It is noted that voltammetry and potentiometry are less used, but they are applied to the study of micro-and nanosized samples. In Russian publications, traditional trends of studies are retained.

A kinetic-spectrophotometric method for the determination of glucose in solutions,"October 2006, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193480610011X,Articles,October 2006,"A kinetic-spectrophotometric method is proposed to determine glucose in solutions. Measurements were performed at 400 nm; the negative peak was obtained by subtracting the absorption spectra of myoglobin (Mb) before and after oxidation. In this method, glucose is added to a mixture of Mb and glucose oxidase. Glucose is oxidized by glucose oxidase and oxygen to gluconate and hydrogen peroxide is generated. The liberated hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the Mb heme (Fe2+) into Fe3+. The higher the glucose concentration added, the more the H2O2 generation, and the more the Mb oxidation (Fe2+ to Fe3+) and, as a result, the higher the absorbance at 400 nm (negative peak, lower absorbance value). The increments of added glucose are monitored by measuring the absorbance decay versus time (0–250 s) at 400 nm. Each glucose concentration has an accompanying unique absorbance value at 250 s. The higher the glucose concentrations, the lower the absorbance at 250 s (measured at 400 nm). The calibration curve for glucose was linear from 0.1 to 3.0 mM; the detection limit was found to be 0.025 mM. There was no interference from major substances present; the only interference was from species that react with H2O2 (ascorbic acid, uric acid, and urea) or that react with glucose (Cu2+ and Fe3+). Standard deviation in the determination was ±0.01 mM for a 1.3 mM glucose solution (n = 10)."

A comparison of the external standard and standard addition methods for the quantitative chromatographic determination of pesticide concentrations in plant samples,"September 2006, issue 5",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-5,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806050030,Articles,September 2006,"Model samples containing known amounts of pesticides in various plant materials were analyzed, and the accuracies of the external standard and standard addition methods were compared based on a criterion such as the relative analyte concentration. It was found that traditionally recommended procedures for the solvent extraction of pesticides from samples of this kind in combination with quantitative analysis by the external standard method determine only 10–70% of the true concentrations of analytes. This is most likely due to analyte adsorption on matrices and/or incomplete extraction. In almost all cases, the use of the standard addition method compensates pesticide losses at the stages of sample preparation and thereby considerably decreases the systematic error of determination. The extrapolation of analyte concentration to the zero amount of the added reference sample was proposed to additionally control the accuracy of results obtained by the standard addition method. Moreover, it was found that solid-phase extraction as the second stage of sample preparation has no considerable advantages over back solvent extraction in terms of the above criterion.

WO3 and In2O3 film sensors were found to have the best sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. However, WO3 films are characterized by a longer relaxation time (3 min) compared to In2O3 films, for which it is no longer than 30 s. The kinetic and steady-state relative conductivity values of In2O3 films as functions of the chlorine concentration in air fall on the same curve in the range 0.01–0.7 ppm. This suggests that the concentration of chlorine in air can be determined from the initial rates of the variation of the relative conductivity of films, which significantly decreases the time of analysis (from 40 to 5 s at a sensor working temperature of 300°C). Changes in air humidity in the range from 40 to 80% have no effect on the initial rates of the variation of the relative conductivity of In2O3 films under kinetic conditions.

Fluorimetric determination of fluorescein at the femtomole level with a self-ordered ring of a sessile droplet on glass slide support,"July 2006, issue 7",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806070082,Articles,July 2006,"A method for fluorimetric microscopic determination of trace amounts of fluorescein at the femtomole level has been developed. Since the solvent evaporates from the droplet on a hydrophobic-treated glass slide, an outward capillary flow of the solvent from the interior of the droplet occurs. The resulting outward capillary flow then carries the solute to the perimeter of the droplet spot, where the solute accumulates to form a fluorescent self-ordered ring (SOR). Depending on the volume of the droplet of fluorescein solution, SORs of different sizes with an outer diameter less than 1.2 mm and a ring belt width less than 24 μm can be obtained. Data analysis for a digitally imaged SOR using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera showed that the fluorescein molecules across the fluorescent SOR belt section follow a Gaussian distribution; the maximum fluorescent intensity at central ring belt (I
max) was found to be proportional to fluorescein content. When a 0.1-μL droplet was spotted on the solid support, fluorescein in a range of 0.6–120 femtomol (or 6.2–1200.0 nM) can be detected, and the limit of detection can reach 62 attomol (or 0.6 nM). With the present method, the contents of fluorescein in fluorescein sodium injections were satisfactorily detected with recoveries of 95–105% and RSD of 3.5 and 4.2%, respectively."

Specific features of the gas-chromatographic determination of the reaction products in the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen sulfide,"April 2006, issue 4",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106193480604006X,Articles,April 2006,"Specific features of the determination of hydrogen sulfide in the presence of hydrogen were studied by gas chromatography with the use of a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas. A chromatographic column with HayeSep A modified with 10 wt % H3PO4 was proposed for the simultaneous determination of both components. It was demonstrated that the elution curve of hydrogen sulfide in an argon atmosphere has a non-Gaussian shape because of the interaction of hydrogen sulfide with the tungsten filament of the sensing element of the catarometer. To eliminate this interaction, it was recommended that a gold-plated tungsten filament be used in the detector."
Gas-chromatographic determination of formic acid in the oxidation products of organic substances,"April 2006, issue 4",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806040071,Articles,April 2006,"Procedures for the gas-chromatographic determination of formic acid in oxidation produts of organic substances after its conversion to benzyl formate were developed. In determining formic acid in an organic phase, free formic acid was esterified with benzyl alcohol in a pyridine solution while adding acetic anhydride under mild conditions. The conversion of formic acid was complete even in the presence of other mono-and dicarboxylic acids in considerable amounts. It was found that the formation of benzyl formate occurred via a mixed aldehyde formed in situ from formic acid and acetic anhydride. The determination of formic acid in aqueous solutions involves the synthesis of its sodium or potassium salt and the successive treatment of this salt with acetyl chloride and benzyl alcohol in a pyridine solution."

The procedures provide accurate and reproducible results of analysis; however, the isocratic version is preferable for mass production control as a technically simpler technique."
Effect of humic acid on absorption-release processes in the bottom sediments-Yenisei river water system as studied by dual-column ion chromatography and γ-ray spectrometry,"April 2006, issue 4",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806040101,Articles,April 2006,"The effect of humic acid on absorption-release processes in the bottom sediments-Yenisei river water system was studied by dual-column ion chromatography and γ-ray spectrometry.

Only the test anions were released in the systems without the introduction of an additional amount of WSOC as humic acid. With the use of γ-ray spectrometry, it was found that the release of 60Co, 152Eu, and 241Am radionuclides to the liquid phase in the systems with added humic acid began much earlier than in the system without the addition of humic acid. In this case, the amount of released radionuclides was greater than the amount of radioisotopes released in the system without the addition of humic acid: ∼25% 241Am, ∼3% 152Eu, and ∼0.8% 60Co in the system with added humic acid or 0.8% 152Eu and <0.1% 60Co in the system without the addition of humic acid. The 241Am radionuclide was not determined in the system without the addition of humic acid. An increase in the concentration of WSOC in the experimental system of bottom sediments-Yenisei river water initiated the release of 60Co, 152Eu, and 241Am anthropogenic radionuclides from bottom sediments because of the formation of soluble complexes capable of migration. An increase in the concentration of WSOC had almost no effect on the release of 40K and 137Cs radionuclides."
Electrochemical studies on the interaction of heparin with crystal violet and its analytical application,"April 2006, issue 4",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806040113,Articles,April 2006,"In this paper, crystal violet (CV) was used to determine heparin concentration by linear sweep voltammetry on a dropping mercury electrode (DME). In Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffer solution, pH 3.0, CV had a well-defined second-order derivative linear sweep voltammetric reductive wave at −0.74 V (vs. SCE). After the addition of heparin to the CV solution, the reductive peak current decreased greatly with the positive movement of the peak potential and without appearance of new peaks in the scanning potential range. Based on the decrease in the reductive peak current, a new voltammetric method for the determination of heparin was established. The conditions for the interaction and the electrochemical detection were optimized, and interfering substances were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the decrease in reductive peak currents of CV was proportional to heparin concentration in the range 0.1–8.0 mg/L with the linear regression equation Δip″(nA) = 400.42 + 1563.11c (mg/L), (n = 14, γ = 0.993). The detection limit was 0.092 mg/L. This new method was further successfully applied to the determination of heparin content in heparin sodium injection samples with satisfactory results. The binding ratio and binding mechanism were also studied by the electrochemical method."

The optimum separation was achieved at pH 11.00 with the use of 10 mM borate buffer containing 0.001% (w/v) of HDB. The applied voltage was ∼15 kV and the capillary temperature was kept constant at 25°C. m-Phthalic acid was used as an internal standard for quantification. The calibration dependences exhibited good linearity for the ratios of the concentrations of standard samples and internal standard and the ratios of the peak area of samples and internal standard over the concentration range from 24 to 1200 μg/mL for GA and 2.4 to 72 μg/mL for S. The correlation coefficients were 0.9999 and 0.9997, and the detection limits of the CE method corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of three were 6 and 2 μg/mL for GA and S, respectively. The relative standard deviations of the relative migration time and the relative peak area of samples were 0.5 and 4.0% for GA and 1.9 and 5.3% for S. The effects of buffer pH and the concentration of HDB on the resolution were studied systematically.

An equation is proposed for processing the results obtained using the linearized graph. This equation eliminates systematic errors due to the retarded kinetics of complexation."
Electrooxidation of oxalic acid at a carbon-paste electrode with deposited palladium nanoparticles,"April 2006, issue 4",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/61-4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934806040149,Articles,April 2006,"Palladium nanoparticles deposited on the surface of a carbon-paste electrode exhibit electrocatalytic activity in the oxidation of oxalic acid. The surface topography of modified carbon-paste electrodes (CPEs) and the shapes of the metal crystallite particles were studied with atomic-force microscopy. These data were correlated with the voltammetric parameters of the electrooxidation of palladium and oxalic acid. As the dispersity of palladium nanoparticles electrodeposited on the CPE surface increased and their size diminished, the peak current of the catalytic oxidation of oxalic acid decreased, whereas the increment of this current increased as compared to the limiting current of metal oxidation. Evidently, this was due to an increase in the catalytic activity of the metal. The use of CPE modified with palladium nanoparticles instead of CPE containing palladium macrocrystals lowered the detection limit for the analyte by one order of magnitude (down to 2 × 10−5 M)."

This can be qualitatively explained by the specific features of ion pair formation between quaternary ammonium cations and singly and doubly charged anions. The effect of the steric accessibility of the QAS exchange center on the selectivity of ISEs is partially retained in the presence of a neutral anion carrier, hexyl p-trifluoroacetylbenzoate (HTFAB), which is used for enhancing the selectivity for the sulfate ion in the presence of singly charged anions. A sulfate-selective electrode with a reasonable selectivity for practical purposes was proposed. It is based on the HTFAB-higher QAS ion pair bearing three methyl substituents at the nitrogen atom. The ISE was used in the analysis of natural water."

The absorption spectra of the reagents immobilized on fabric matrices exhibit hypsochromic or bathochromic shifts of absorption bands (2–45 nm as compared to their absorption spectra in solution). As a rule, the degree of retention is higher for the reagents that exhibit a shift of the absorption band on the support. The adsorption isotherms of the reagents on various cellulose supports are analyzed. Test procedures are developed for the determination of antimony and mercury using modified fabric matrices. The rapidity, precision, and sensitivity of previously developed procedures for the test determination of Cu(II), Cd, and S2− are improved. The relative standard deviations of the determinations are no more than 0.1; the analysis time is 5–10 min."

Ni, Co, and Zn are among toxic metals of significance for environmental surveillance. Therefore, determination of these elements in wastewater is very important. This paper reports the use of an adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetric technique for the simultaneous determination of Ni(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) with dimethylglyoxime (DMG) as a chelating agent. Voltammograms of Ni(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) initially contained three peaks corresponding to these metals. However, the peaks overlapped. Therefore, the effect of organic solvents was studied, and the results showed that the use of a suitable ratio of ethanol-water (1:5) solvent and pH provided peaks that were distinctly separated. The metals can be quantified at concentrations above 0.03 (Ni), 0.02 (Co), and 0.1 μg/mL (Zn). The RSD (%) at concentration levels of 0.10 μg/mL Ni(II), 0.10 μg/mL Co(II), and 0.30 μg/mL Zn(II) is 2.3, 2.0, and 3.3%, respectively. The influence of pH, DMG concentration, scan rate, accumulations time, and potential was investigated. The method was satisfactorily used for determination of the metals under study in water and wastewater."

Studying the electrooxidation kinetics of Tl (Zn, Cd, Pb) showed that the rate constant and the transport coefficient at this electrode are independent of the electrode polarization rate.

Injection of a known volume of basic solution into the acidic reagent flow generates a yellow stain at the display part of the detector. The behavior of the stain area (or length) was studied during its passage through the detector for quantitative estimation of the analyte concentration. As the area of the stain strongly depends on the sample volume rather than on analyte concentration, a mathematical method for comparing the analyte concentrations at different sample volumes is suggested. The operational principles and mechanism of the detector are simple, and anyone can easily extract analytical information from the resulting stain shape and length. The system is amenable to extension to a variety of colored chemical reactions based on the lack of a need for reagent immobilization. Up to one sample per 5 min can be analyzed with an RSD of about 4%. As low as 1 × 104 M of NaOH can be detected and measured."

It has been shown by both experimental and theoretical considerations that better results can by obtained by proper selection of the spectral range to be included in calculations. A genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most popular methods for selecting variables for PLS calibration of mixtures with almost identical spectra without loss of predictive capability. In this work, a simple and precise method for rapid and accurate simultaneous determination of sulfide and sulfite ions based on the addition reaction of these ions with new fuchsin at pH 8 and 25°C using PLS regression and GA for variable selection is proposed. The concentrations of sulfide ions varied between 0.05–2.50 and 0.15–2.00 μg/mL, respectively. A series of model solutions containing different concentrations of sulfide and sulfite were used to check the predictive ability of GA-PLS models. The root mean square error of prediction with PLS on the whole data set was 0.19 μg/mL for sulfide and 0.09 μg/mL for sulfite. After the application of GA, these values reduced to 0.04 and 0.03 μg/mL, respectively."

The results of testing this device are presented. The device allows obtaining reproducible areas and properties of the surfaces of solid indicator electrodes by mechanically cutting 0.1–5-µm surface layers. The best reproducibility of these parameters is attained when a hexanite-R cutter is used. The serviceability of the cutter is more than 105 cuts. The high-quality renewal of electrode surfaces is achieved by cutting a 4– 5-µm layer of metallic (Pt, Ag, Au, Cu, Cd, Zn, Co, Ni, etc.) electrodes and a 0.1–1.5-µm layer of graphite and graphite-based electrodes. Optimum tool angles of the cutter for all types of solid electrodes are selected. Long-term tests of the developed technique for the mechanical renewal of electrode surface confirm that the electrode surface area is well reproducible in the series of 104 measurements of the analytical signal (RSD = 0.2–0.6%). Examples are given that point to the enhancement of the electrochemical activity of the surfaces of some electrodes renewed in situ in a solution without their exposure to air. It is shown that the mechanical regeneration of the electrode surface in the solution is the main condition for depositing metals under high-voltage (up to 1000 V) conditions for electroaccumulation. The advantages of the proposed technique are exemplified by determining the concentrations of cations, anions, and some organic substances by direct and stripping voltammetry."

With many laboratories initiating research in the area of (U-Th)/He thermochronology, we recognize that there may be interest in a review of analytical procedures for uranium and thorium determination in single crystals of apatite, zircon, rutile, and fluorite. Uranium and thorium are both determined by inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry using an isotope dilution method. While standard and spike solutions can be purchased, their isotopic composition and the concentration of the standard solution need to be verified. Digestion procedures for apatite and fluorite are relatively straightforward, but zircon decomposition requires the use of pressure vessels or fusion. Matrix effects are shown to have an insignificant effect on isotope ratios, although isobaric interferences, particularly of PtAr+ on U isotopes, can be a problem. We include complete thermochronology datasets for replicate analysis of Durango apatite, Yucca Mountain fluorite, and an Australian megacryst zircon."

Cyclic voltammetric signals at BDD electrode for 10 mM Br− and I− were observed at 561 and 125 mV vs. SCE; the values shifted negatively for 228.7 and 187.5 mV, respectively, compared to those at GC electrode. It was also found that the peak current of Br− and I− was in direct proportion to the scan rate, which is indicative of a surface confined reduction process. Sensitive amperometric responses for Br− and I− were obtained covering the linear ranges 0.666 µM–1 mM and 13.3 nM–1 mM, respectively, and their detection limits were 0.53 µM and 1.67 nM, respectively, under the optimum pH and applied potential. The amperometric response was very reproducible and stable with satisfactory recovery results."

Role of Frontier Molecular Orbital Symmetry of Reagents in Redox Catalytic Indicator Reactions,"November 2005, issue 11",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/60-11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10809-005-0242-3,Articles,November 2005,"Some hypotheses are discussed for the nature of “inhibited” or “kinetically hindered” redox reactions, which are employed as indicator reactions in kinetic analytical methods. Some reactions are considered as examples to demonstrate that redox reactions are kinetically hindered because the key frontier orbitals of the reagents differ in their symmetry types. It is suggested that the redox reactions of this type be considered forbidden by inconsistency between the symmetry types of the key frontier orbitals."

It is found that the reactions are orbital controlled and their regioselectivity is unambiguously governed by the thermodynamic properties of the intermediate σ-complexes and by the effect of the aqueous medium. The latter causes high site selectivity, providing the choice of one of the two possible reaction channels predicted on the basis of quantum-chemical calculations of the isolated molecular systems. As a result, azo coupling occurs at the 4-position of the 1-aminonaphthalene molecule. Additionally, the aqueous medium provides the selection of analytical forms, namely, the protonated azo coupling products that have the quinone-hydrazone structure. On the basis of the quantum-chemical study, the analytical performances of the two azo coupling reactions mentioned above are discussed."

The variations of absorbance, which arise as a consequence of the surfactant addition to aqueous solutions of Cr(VI) or Cr(III), were measured. Depressions were observed below the critical micelle concentration (CMC), whereas enhancements were observed above the CMC. These depressions are more significant when the surfactant is opposite in charge to the analyte and the longest surfactant chain is used. A mechanism that enables explanation of the effects of a surfactant on FAAS is also suggested. This mechanism is based on the preferential orientation of surfactant molecules to the surface of nebulized droplets."

The adsorbent capacity for the barium complex of DCH18C6 was higher than that for the complex of DB18C6 by a factor of about 4. Depending on the proton-acceptor ability of the adsorbate, the surface layer of alkyl radicals and residual silanol groups behaves as a solid surface or a liquid phase. In the latter case, a supramolecular cavity complementary to the adsorbate is formed in the surface phase. Thus, alkylated silica gel undergoes self-organization with regard to the properties of the adsorbate. This hypothesis explains the unusual adsorption of barium complexes."

This can be interpreted in terms of the absence of specific properties. Exceptions were found only among stationary phases bearing some specific molecular fragments (such as nitro groups) and individual crown ethers."

Copolymers of polyamides, methyl methacrylate (PMMA), and poly(dimethylsiloxanes) (PDMSs) were examined. It was shown that the sensitivity of the spectral parameters of polymers in absorption spectra of their films upon the action of SO2 in vacuum depends on the chemical and phase composition of polymers. For a sensor with a sensing layer based on PDMSs, linear calibration graphs on logarithmic coordinates were obtained in a wide range of SO2 concentrations in an air flow (5–6200 mg/m3). It was found that the slope of the calibration graph depends on the thickness of the sensing layer, other conditions being the same. The calculated detection limit is of about 3 mg/m3, which points to the possibility of using the proposed OCS for controlling the air of the working area."

The variations in analyte recoveries by sonication periods were investigated and optimum recovery conditions were determined. The leachates of the soil samples, Mn and Pb, were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The recoveries of ULM were tested by comparing the results with those of the conventional extraction method (CE) for Mn and Pb. With regard to the dissolution process, higher recoveries were obtained using ULM than with CE in a relatively shorter time. The precision of the method was found to be 1.9–3.7% for Pb and 4.6–8.4% for Mn (n = 4), as the average in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD%) depended on the analyte element concentrations and the nature of the samples. Using the ULM-FAAS method, significant results were obtained for Mn and Pb as vehicle exhaust pollutants. The pollution factors (PFs) obtained for Mn and Pb correlated mainly with vehicle exhaust emissions in different parts of Sivas and partly with some specific environmental conditions."

In this work, a mathematical model is proposed to describe the behavior of solid particles in the carrier liquid flow in rotating coiled columns. The motion of particles in the flow of a carrier liquid and their migration along the column walls are considered. Equations relating the velocity, radius, and density of a particle; the density and viscosity of the carrier liquid; and the operational and construction parameters of the rotating column are derived. Some practical recommendations are made for the selection and optimization of fractionation conditions."

The technique is based on the formation of symmetrical diastereomeric derivatives upon the interaction of enantiomers with bifunctional achiral reagents: dimethyldichlorosilane, bromochloromethane, and dibromoethane. The reagents were chosen from the viewpoint of the synthesis of diastereomers with a minimum distance between the chiral centers. This minimum distance is responsible for a difference in the energies of interaction of the derivatives with the stationary liquid phase, which is sufficient for the separation of these derivatives."
An optical chemical sensor based on functional polymer films for controlling sulfur dioxide in the air of the working area: Acrylonitrile and alkyl methacrylate copolymers with brilliant green styrene sulfonate,"March 2005, issue 3",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/60-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10809-005-0084-z,Articles,March 2005,"The effects of the chemical and phase composition of acrylonitrile and alkyl methacrylate (Alkyl-MA) copolymers with styrene sulfonates (SS) of triphenylmethane dye cations on the gas permeability and sensing properties of their films were studied for developing an optical chemical sensor (OCS) for sulfur dioxide (SO2) on the basis of functional polymers. Of the three triphenylmethane dyes tested, namely, fuchsine, Crystal Violet, and Brilliant Green (BG), only the last dye was selected for molecular design. It was shown that the copolymer of Decyl-MA with SS—BG with the degree of modification DM = 0.10 is the best material among the studied ones from the viewpoints of sensitivity, response time, and time stability of sensor characteristics. The conditions for fabricating polymer films and the parameters of their functioning in OCSs for SO2 were optimized. The effect of annealing conditions on the sensitivity of spectra to SO2 was studied. Working temperature, working wavelength, and the conditions for the regeneration of the initial spectral parameters were optimized. Calibration characteristics of OCSs for the dynamic admittance of SO2—air mixtures were obtained. The calculated detection limit for SO2 in an air flow for a sensor with a sensing film fabricated of the decyl-MA—SS—BG copolymer with DM = 0.10 was 0.16 vol %, or 4160 mg/m3. This points to the necessity of searching for more sensitive sensing materials among other classes of functional polymers."

Additionally, a combination of the developed technique with the on-line pre-concentration of low concentrations of nitrites in surface and potable waters was investigated. The technique is based on the reaction of nitrites with thiocyanates. The product of the analytical reaction (nitroso-S-thiocyanate) and its adducts with strong acids are stable in aqueous solutions, which is supported by quantum chemical calculations. It is shown that the reaction chosen is attractive for analytical applications, because it is highly selective. A decrease in the detection limit down to 1.5 ng/mL (3s) is achieved by combining FIA with on-line ion-exchange preconcentration. The technique developed is used for monitoring nitrites in natural and waste water. The throughput capacity is 300 samples per hour."

In this method, a sample is placed in the vaporizer of a two-step atomizer, dried, and vaporized. The sample vapor is transferred to an unheated atomizer cell with a flow of argon and trapped by the inner surface of cell walls. This procedure can be performed repeatedly to preconcentrate mercury in the atomizer cell. Next, a portion of the sample transferred to the inner surface of the atomizer cell is revaporized and atomized by heating the atomizer cell of the two-step atomizer with a purged vaporizer, and the atomic absorption of mercury is measured. It was found that the degree of mercury transfer and trapping is as high as 100% at sufficiently high temperatures of primary vaporization, regardless of the material of the inner surface of the atomizer cell. The detection limits for mercury were 0.24 or 0.024 µg/L for drinking water at a sample volume of 100 µL using a single sample transfer or the procedure repeated ten times, respectively, and 2.0 µg/L for urine at a sample volume of 20 µL and a single sample transfer.

The 11C and 13N radionuclides forming in photoneutron reactions were isolated by high-temperature extraction; their positron activity was then deactivated by the method of gamma-gamma coincidence of annihilation gamma quanta. A clear correlation was found between the sample darkness and the carbon concentration; the latter was at a level of 10-2 wt %. No correlations was observed for nitrogen; its concentration was one order of magnitude lower than that of carbon and varied over the range (2–6) ×10-3 wt %. The results obtained suggest that carbon entered different structural defects in chondrites as a result of its redistribution upon gaseous activity on parent bodies.

This reaction was very interesting. The complexation of Cu(II) with NBBB happened at pH between 6 and 11 but the redox catalytic reaction happened at pH over 11, where copper(II) served as a catalyst. In this study, ordinary spectrophotometry was limited for use because of the serious interference of excess reactant. A new method, Β-correction principle, was applied because it can eliminate the above interference. This method can give the simple determination of properties of Cu-NBBB complex solution at pH 9.5, which involved the complex ratio, real molar absorptivity, and stability constant (K). Results showed that the formed Cu-NBBB complex occurred as Cu(NBBB) at pH 9.5, its real rather than apparent absorptivity was equal to 7.62 x 103 L mol-1 cm-1 at 630 nm, and its stability constant was 1.32 x 106. The redox catalytic reaction between Cu(II) and NBBB at pH 13 was used to determine trace amounts of copper in water. This reaction was very sensitive and highly selective. Most of the metals did not interfere with the direct determination of copper.

This complex is adsorbed on microcrystalline naphthalene in the pH range 4.5-7.8 from large volumes of aque ous solutions of various alloys and biological and environmental samples containing nickel. After filtration, the solid mass consisting of nickel complex and naphthalene was dissolved in 5 mL of dimethylformamide, and the metal was determined using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer at a wavelength of 232 nm. Alternatively, nickel can be quantitatively adsorbed on [l-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol]-naphthalene adsorbent packed in a column and determined similarly. The calibration curve is linear over the concentration range 2.0-100 Μg of nickel in 5 mL of the final dimethylformamide solution. Eight replicate determinations of 20 Μg of nickel give a mean absorbance of 0.072 with a relative standard deviation of 1.3%. The sensitivity for 1% absorption is 0.24 Μg/mL. Various parameters such as the effect of pH, the volume of the aqueous phase, and the interference of a large number of metal ions with the determination of nickel have been studied in detail to optimize the conditions for its determination in various standard alloys and biological and environmental samples."

Mutual correlation between gas chromatographic retention indices of unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons found by molecular dynamics,"October 2000, issue 10",/journal/10809/volumes-and-issues/55-10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02756091,Articles,October 2000,"It is shown that gas Chromatographic retention indices for cycloalkenes can be calculated from the corresponding data for cycloalkanes (and vice versa) using computer simulation of intramolecular vibrational and rotational processes by molecular dynamics. For organic compounds structurally related asA → B, the total internal energy differences δE = E(B)-E(A) correlate with the corresponding differences in retention indices δI = I(B)-I(A), and a linear relationship exists δI =aδE + b (a < 0, ¦ρ¦ > 0.9). Limitations are found for the use of molecular dynamics for compounds havingn-alkyl radicals with no less than four carbon atoms. In these cases, a simpler model for the evaluation of dynamic molecular parameters should be preferred for the calculation of retention indices of acyclic alkenes and alkanes. The reliability of the retention indices evaluated by the proposed technique is comparable to their interlaboratory reproducibility found using standard nonpolar poly(dimethylsiloxane) stationary phases."

The surfactants, emulsifier OP and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), may both increase the sensitivity and the solubility of Cd-DBCBAA complex. Because of the strong interference of excess of ligand, the conventional spectrophotometry was limited for use. The current principle, named Β-correction theory has been applied instead of single wavelength method because it can eliminate the above interference. Such a method can give the simple determination of complex characteristic factors such as the complex ratio, real molar absorptivity (ε) and step or cumulative stability constant (K). Results showed that the two formed Cd-DBCBAA complexes were both expressed as Cd(DBCBAA)4 at pH 12.5, their real not apparent absorptivities were first to be determined equal to 1.85 x 105 L mol-1 cm-1 in the presence of OP at 520 nm and 2.05 x 105 L mol-1 cm-1 in the presence of SDBS at 530 nm and the cumulative stability constants of complexes equaled 4.90 x 1022, and 8.64 x 1022 respectively.

The electrolytic deposition of a binary system of copper and thallium, cadmium, lead, or mercury on the electrode in an alkaline solution resulted in the disappearance of the electroreduction peak of dissolved oxygen in the potential range from -0.8 to -1.4 V and in a decrease in the background current. Under the conditions of limited diffusion, the peak currents of Ni(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) in differential pulse voltammograms were 3–7 times higher than those calculated for a reversible electrode process under the conditions of semi-infinite diffusion. Because of this, the determination limit for metal ions in direct voltammetry was lowered to 1 X 10-6 M. With a binary copper-thallium system, the peak current of zinc(II) reduction can be be detected in the presence of 5000-fold molar amounts of copper(II). The deposition of binary copper-lead and copper-thallium systems under the conditions of limited diffusion reduced the effect of negative interaction between the components of these systems and made possible the determination of lead(II) and thallium(I) by stripping voltammetry using additional peaks."

Organic substances can be divided into three groups: easily oxidizable compounds that are oxidized by 80–100% without a catalyst; medium-oxidizable compounds that are oxidized by 40–80% in the absence of a catalyst; and hardly oxidizable compounds that are oxidized by less than 40% without a catalyst. It was shown that, in the presence of a catalyst, not all organic substances are completely oxidized; therefore, the verification of the results of the determination of COD using easily oxidizable potassium hydrophthalate and glucose cannot be reliable in the presence of more hardly oxidizable substances. A standard mixture containing ethylene glycol, acetic acid, dimethylformamide, and nitrobenzene was proposed to verify the results of determining COD in waters of any type. The error in COD values found in a standard mixture varied in the range from 15 to 840 mg O/L. A modified procedure for the determination of COD in pure waters was proposed."

Artifacts due to the Chromatographie interference of various preparations and their metabolites were revealed. The lability of the anesthetics and their metabolites in the course of sample preparation and analysis by gas chromatography (GC) was examined. The degradation products of the test preparations responsible for the generation of false positive results were found. Phentanyl, Promedol, ketamine, tramadol, Thiopental, diazepam, and their metabolites excreted with urine in the free forms were determined in the whole blood and urine of surgical patients. Bound forms of metabolites and the initial medicinal preparations excreted as complexes with glucuronic acid and other acids were also determined in urine. Metabolites and impurity substances in the intravenous anesthetics with similar mass spectra and retention times were distinguished. Methodological recommendations concerning the analysis of difficult-to-separate (by capillary gas chromatography) pairs of substances used for intravenous anesthesia and their metabolites are given. The following pairs of components are difficult to separate: Norpromedol-2-methylamino-5-chlorobenzophenon (a product of diazepam hydrolysis), norketamine-Promedol, and anhydrotramadol (a GC artifact)-ketamine. The cumulation of an impurity substance from the tramadol preparation, identified by us as epoxytramadol, in the body was examined."
